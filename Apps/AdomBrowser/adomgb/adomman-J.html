<a name="J1"></a><h3>Magic and Spells</h3>
The world of Ancardia is steeped in powerful magic.  Although these
forces have been far stronger in earlier ages and slowly seem to be
declining in might, they are still a major force to be reckoned with.<p>

The world of Ancardia is the home of many powerful wizards of various
schools and specialization.  Priests are also able to use magical
spells very similar to the ones utilized by wizards (although the
sources for these powers are very different).<p>

All magic is fueled by mana, the magical energy called the fifth
element by some.  In ADOM the mana attribute of the player character
is the major factor in determining how well he is able to channel
magical spells (although both race and profession also have great
influence on this).<p>

Spells have to be learned from books.  When reading such a book, the
character meditates about the forces and magical patterns which are
required to create the magical effect in question and attunes himself
to the mana flow of the world in such a way as to be able to activate
the specific spell.  How well he is able to do this depends on a
number of factors -- among them the Learning attribute, the
Concentration skill, the class and more.  ADOM uses a special number
to describe the current attunement to the mana flow of Ancardia for
each and every spell the character learns.  The more often a spell is
cast, the less close the attunement of the character to the mana flow
will be as his actions change the mana flow and force him to re-attune
him by again studying spellbooks.
Thus this number decreases with each spell casting until it is finally
reduced to zero and the character is no longer able to cast the spell.<p>

On the other hand, a character becomes more efficient in casting a
specific spell if he does so very often.  Training allows him to
adjust the various factors involved in casting a spell until he
maximizes the gain from such a spell.  This learning factor is
described by the term 'Spell Power'.  The character needs to cast a
spell 'x' times to increase his power with that spell by +1.  The
value 'x' depends on the current power (the better you already are,
the harder it is to improve) and can be determined like this:<p>

If the current power is '+x', the character needs to cast the spell 'x
+ 1' times to become even more efficient.  If the character is neither
a wizard, elementalist, druid, priest, or necromancer, this number is
tripled.  If the character is either a magician (wizard, elementalist
or necromancer) and tries to cast a priest spell or if he is a cleric
(druid or priest) and tries to cast a wizard spell, this number is
doubled.<p>

Power has various effects: it increases the range and/or damage of
combat spells, it heightens the effects of personal and healing magic
and so on.  Each spell description lists those effects.  Finally, high
power with a spell reduces the costs for casting such spells.  For
each 5 levels of power with a given spell, the spell costs are reduced
by 1 power point per casting.  Note that this reduction can't reduce
the cost to a level lower than half the original cost.<p>

IMPORTANT: Power can never be increased to a level higher than twice
your learning score.  If, on the other hand, your learning score is
reduced below a certain spell power, the power rating will remain at
its current level.<p>

<a name="J2"></a><h3>Spell Display</h3>
Pressing 'Z' will display all the spells you know and some additional
data concerning them.  Following each spell you will notice several
numbers.  The first one describes how well you memorized the spell. It
is decreased whenever the spell is cast (by an amount determined by
the power level of the spell, your attributes, and some other
factors). If this number is reduced to 0 or less, the spell is
forgotten and you are no longer able to cast it.  The second number is
the number of power points you need to expend to cast the spell in
question.  If you do not have that many power points, you can still
cast the spell.  But beware -- this is very dangerous.  The strain
imposed by casting a spell in such a way could kill you, if you are
not completely healed.<p>

Afterwards a series of statistics follow which explain the spell
effects in more detail. The following values are possible:<p>
<ul>
<li>  P: x - The spell is cast with power 'x'.
<li>	R: x - The spell has a range or radius of 'x'. If the
               range 'LOS' is given, this means "Line of Sight" -
               as far as the PC can see.
<li>	D: x - The spell lasts for 'x' turns.
<li>	E: x - The spell effect is 'x'. Mostly this will be damage
               caused or cured. If the term '+R*' appears in the
               effect value this means that the effect decreases
               with distance. You can assume that the modifier
               is equal to the range R at distance 1, to
               (range R - 1) at distance 2 and so on.
</ul><p>

<a name="J3"></a><h3>Casting Spells from Books</h3>
It is also possible to cast a spell from a spellbook if you already
have learned the particular spell.  Doing so costs quintuple the
amount of power points usually required, takes up 3000 energy points
(casting from a book takes more time since you have to loudly invoke
the text) and does not reduce your current spell knowledge.  It also
does not destroy the spellbook after a limited amount of readings,
either.  Since casting a spell from a book simply consists of
following the instructions in the book, the spell power for
the spell in question is not increased.<p>

<a name="J4"></a><h3>Known Spells</h3>
This section summarizes the various spells known in Ancardia.  Please
note that it should be considered to be but a short summary of the
various spells -- there might be yet unknown powerful castings.<p>

First the spell name is listed.  If two names are given, separated by
a /, the first one is the name commonly used by members of the arcane
professions (wizards, elementalists and necromancers), while the
second name is the one used by members of the clerical professions
(priests, druids and paladins).  Then you'll find in brackets the
profession groups specifically suited to learning the spell.
Effectively, this means that members of those profession groups will
have an easier time to understand and learn the spell.  Increasing
power also is simpler for members of those groups.  For them the costs
are determined as explained above.  For members of the 'other'
profession group, the costs are doubled.  For characters neither
having an arcane nor a clerical profession, costs are tripled.
Paladins using clerical magic only pay double the normal cost to
increase power.  Lastly, you will find a description of the spell
effects.<p>

The descriptions include formulae to determine range, damage and
duration for spells.  These formulae use certain abbreviations:<p>

<ul>
<li>        W - Willpower of the PC.
<li>        M - Mana of the PC.
<li>        L - Level of the PC.
<li>        P - Spell Power for the given spell.
<li>        R - Maximum range (as determined by the range formula).
<li>        r - Remaining range points when target is hit.
</ul><p>

It also uses a maximum function denoted as M{x, y}, which means "take
the maximum of x and y".  The minimum function m{x, y} is defined
accordingly.  Finally, the die-rolling notation is used (see the
respective section in the manual for details).<p>

Example: A damage of M{L + 2, W - 2}d6 + (L + W) / 4 means that to
determine damage, you first choose the maximum value of your level + 2
and your willpower - 2.  Roll the appropriate number of d6 and add to
the result a number determined by adding level and willpower divided by 4.
Confusing, eh?  Feel assured that you don't need to understand this to
be able to play ADOM -- it just helps those die-hard tacticians.<p>

difference that it causes more damage and can be hurled at targets

<a name="09"></a><h3>Killing monsters</h3>
The <a href="adomman-I.html">ADOM Manual</a> has a section about experience and 
advancement, which is achieved mainly via killing monsters.<p>

<a name="091"></a><h4>0.9.1 The significance of the first kill</h4>
Many new ADOM players are dismayed to find that they need to know what monster 
their PC killed first. By the time they find this out, they have forgotten, of 
course. Write it down, rename your PC to reflect your first kill, do anything 
necessary to remember that first kill. It is very important, especially if you 
are going to attempt an ultra ending.<p>

<a name="0911"></a><h4>0.9.1.1 The Courage skill</h4>
There is a description of the Courage skill in the <a href="adomman-E.html#Courage">ADOM Manual</a>. It is 
worthwhile to acquire it, although many players ignore it and have finished the 
game without it. The skill is obtained by finishing the Old Barbarian's quest: 
kill an additional score (20) of the monster your PC first killed. Note that 
the Old Barbarian will not give the quest to PCs who have chaotic alignment.<p>

<a name="0912"></a><h4>0.9.1.2 The Filk quest</h4>
The Filk quest is for very advanced players attempting an ultra ending. The 
quest objective is to find and kill the named quickling bard Filk. He can be 
found in the Infinite Dungeon on the level number corresponding to the number 
of first-kill monsters the PC has killed. This will of course be a minimum 
of 21 if the PC has acquired the Courage skill. It can also change during 
the quest if the PC kills additional first-kill monsters after being assigned 
the quest. See section <a href="adomgb-4.html#4311">4.3.1.1</a> for more about the Filk quest.<p>

<a name="0913"></a><h4>0.9.1.3 Strategy for the first kill: where and what?</h4>
There are many schools of thought on what the first kill should be. If the PC 
wants to acquire the Courage skill quickly after being assigned the Old 
Barbarian's quest, the monsters should be readily available. If the PC 
also plans to do the Filk quest later in the game, the total number of 
first-killed monsters killed must be minimized in order to prevent a tedious 
and dangerous dive into the Infinite Dungeon. Some experienced players will 
ignore the Old Barbarian's quest for the Courage skill. This makes it very 
easy to complete the Filk quest, since if the player has chosen wisely the PC 
will have killed only one of the monsters in question. Some players choose to 
make the first kill in Lawenilothehl for this reason. Muggers, for instance, 
are found only in Lawenilothehl and the Assassins' Guild. Skriek, the ratling 
found in Lawenilothehl, is the only cloaked ratling in the game (although killing 
him means the PC can no longer buy keys from him, which can save the PC's life). 
Hotzenplotz, who is also located in Lawenilothehl, is the only crime lord in the 
game. He is not easy for an experience level one PC to kill, but it can be done 
with wizards who have a good offensive bolt spell (not Magic Missile), or 
hurthling archers who start the game with level five skill in thrown rocks. 
Hotzenplotz's guardians Grunge and Munge are likewise the only two half-orc 
bouncers in the game.<p>

If the PC wants the Courage skill and wants to attempt an ultra ending, the 
following requirements must be met: the first kill must be a monster readily 
available after receiving the Old Barbarian's quest; it must also be uncommon 
in the various dungeons the PC will face so that the Filk quest does not get 
out of control. Entering the Small Cave at the start of the game and killing 
a rat, kobold or goblin as the first kill, for instance, makes it much more 
difficult to finish an ultra ending.<p>

<a name="092"></a><h4>0.9.2 Cats - the significance of felines</h4>
There are three types of monsters that count as cats in ADOM: cave lions, cave 
tigers and wild cats.<p>

The Cat Lord resides on D: 35 in the Caverns of Chaos. He rewards PCs who have 
avoided killing any cats with a powerful artifact ring. He will be hostile 
towards PCs that have killed cats and becomes more powerful with each cat killed 
(+10 HP for each cat killed, +1 level for each 25 cats killed, max level 20).<p>

Many players consider the Ring of the Master Cat to be the most powerful and 
desirable ring in the game. It grants +16 to Dexterity and +16 to speed. In 
addition it causes the PC to deliver considerably more critical hits with melee 
and missile weapons and grants the Fate smiles intrinsic.<p>

It is important to remember that even after receiving the ring, the PC must not 
kill any cats while wearing it, since it explodes in that circumstance. The 
ring does not explode if it is in the backpack or left on another level when a 
cat is killed after receiving the RotMC.<p>

Make no mistake about it, the requirement to kill no cats for the entire game is 
a difficult one, causing many to refer to them as "those damn cats." The power 
of the ring makes it worthwhile to attempt to avoid killing them.<p>

There are several ways to deal with cats. Teleportation is one, from a wand or 
spell. Either teleport the cat away, especially if the PC does not have 
teleport control, or teleport the PC. Potions of exchange thrown at a cat will 
turn it into another monster. Potions of raw chaos, available at any time once 
the PC has Moon Sickle, will turn cats into writhing masses of primal chaos when 
thrown at cats. Cats can be led over traps until they are killed or turned into 
a writhing mass of primal chaos. Luring a cat across an alarm trap causes other 
monsters to become hostile and attack the cat. Note that in newer versions of 
ADOM, the PC is charged with killing a cat if he creates or sets off a trap that 
kills a cat. Wands of destruction can be used to safely kill cats since monsters 
"destroyed" in this way do not appear in the kill list.<p>

PCs that are near Dwarftown can bring cats to Dwarftown and have the Priest, for 
instance, kill them. This is probably a bit dangerous, since bringing hostile 
monsters into Dwarftown repeatedly may eventually result in some of the 
inhabitants becoming hostile. It should also be possible for PCs near the 
Banshee's level to bring cats to her level and have her wail kill them. 
Additional monsters that can be used include vortices. Lure a cat close enough 
to one and allow it to explode. Be familiar with vortices before trying this.<p>

Companions can kill cats for you. Cave lions and wild cats can be tamed with 
rat and/or giant rat corpses, if you have enough of them. Cave tigers can 
eventually be tamed with pieces of fresh and/or raw meat, but it requires five 
or more pieces. If the PC can become invisible, and has not attacked the cat in 
question, it can simply be walked away from. Cats can be confused with the 
Ventriloquism skill. While they are confused, run away. Cats can probably be 
confused or blinded by throwing potions of confusion or blindness at them. 
Again the run away tactic would be used.<p>

<a name="093"></a><h4>0.9.3 Karmic beings</h4>
Karmic monsters come in three main varieties: karmic lizards, karmic dragons 
and ancient karmic dragons. They can be identified by the fact that they 
change color with each turn. Be very careful if the PC encounters a lizard 
with the 'w'alk command. It may allow the PC to wind up right next to the 
lizard, in which case you may not have time to notice the color change. 
Karmics demand caution because attacking them in melee causes the PC to lose 
the Fate smiles intrinsic, then the Lucky intrinsic followed by cursing then
dooming if the PC continues. This is not a 100% guaranteed effect. PCs can 
kill karmics in one hit and not suffer the consequences. However, it happens 
so often that karmics should not be engaged in melee if it is possible to 
avoid it. Killing them with magic, missiles, Mindcraft or companions is the 
way to dispatch them. The changing color of karmics reflects the nature of 
karmic dragons. They breathe not one element, like ordinary dragons, but have 
*all* the breath attacks available, varying from turn to turn depending on 
their color. This also means that they are immune to all elemental magical 
attacks. Unfortunately karmic dragon scale mail is not available in the game. 
;-) They are vulnerable to dragon slaying ammo.<p>

There are such things as karmic wyrms. There is one guaranteed in the game. 
Thankfully, he is not initially hostile. Another being shares the 
cursing/dooming property of karmics: Filk, the quickling bard.<p>

Karmic beings will occasionally leave corpses when killed. Eating the corpse 
of a karmic being will, in order, remove the doomed intrinsic if present, remove 
the cursed intrinsic if present, grant the Lucky intrinsic if not present and 
grant the Fate smiles intrinsic if not present. Remember all or any of these
intrinsics can be present simultaneously. Thus a PC that is doomed and Lucky 
would lose the doomed intrinsic and retain the Lucky intrinsic after eating a 
karmic corpse. The same is true for a PC that has the cursed and doomed 
intrinsics - the PC would lose the doomed intrinsic but not the cursed intrinsic 
and would not gain either the Lucky or Fate smiles intrinsics.<p>

<a name="094"></a><h4>0.9.4 Dragons</h4>
The various dragons have particular vulnerabilities noted in
 <a href="adomgb-app-J.html">Appendix J</a>. They have a unique characteristic
when killed: a dragon that has picked up gold pieces will drop twice as many 
when killed, in addition to whatever gold and other treasure it may have been
carrying. This is probably a bug and can obviously be used to multiply the 
PC's gold potentially indefinitely once he is buff enough to dispatch dragons.
There is some risk involved since many types of dragons can destroy entire 
heaps of gold with their breath attacks.
Note that the amount of gold in a single stack is limited to a 32-bit integer 
(2<sup>31</sup> - 1 or 2,147,483,647). Generating larger stacks will cause errors.<p>

<a name="095"></a><h4>0.9.5 Strategies for dealing with particularly annoying monsters</h4>
Suggestions for more annoying monsters are welcome. No uniques, though - 
they are dealt with in the section pertaining to their location.<p>

This section is about *annoying* monsters. Not necessarily very dangerous 
or life-threatening, just monsters that are your personal pet peeve with some 
attack or characteristic that infuriates you.<p>

<a name="0951"></a><h4>0.9.5.1 Early game</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>claw bugs</b> - Since claw bugs always ignore PV (luckily, they never damage
 armor) and there are almost no wearable items substantially 
 increasing DV at this point in the game, fighting them in true 
 berserker mode - wearing nothing and switching tactics to berserker 
 (see section <a href="adomgb-0-7.html#074">0.7.4</a>) might be worthwhile.
			In this mode, there are 
 good bonuses to to-hit and to-damage values - usually enough to take 
 them out in one hit. Of course, this is not necessary once the PC 
 has some missiles and/or spells to take them out. Note that claw 
 bugs are immune to Mindcraft as are all insects. They are very 
 fragile and pose a threat only due to their numerous (8 per turn!) 
 armor-punching attacks.<p>

<li><b>dark elven priestesses/princesses</b>
- These monsters, nicknamed "spider factories," have the following nasty traits:
they summon spiders (poisoning monsters with high DV and PV that quickly gets even higher) quickly and in large numbers,
they occasionally shoot energy bolts,
they are highly magic resistant,
they have a corrupting hit (princesses only?), princesses also can paralyze in melee.

Spiders (like all animals) can't open doors. If you can put closed doors between you and all the exits the spiders
can use, you'll be protected until something else wades through them and opens them. You may also need to seek ways
to slow the spiders (Slow Monster, stunning, paralyzation, confusion, ventriloquism, etc.) so you can actually
close the door.
Spider corpses poison you shortly, but grant permanent poison resistance. Eat one as soon as you find one and can
get a breather.
Obviously bolt spells/wands are good against the spiders, though early characters often have too few PP/charges to
use them easily for the task. Try to zap the summoner along with the summoned. In the rare cases where they don't
resist, they tend to die quickly -- they have low HP. <p>

<li><b>ghuls</b> - They are only dangerous because of their paralyzation ability.
Otherwise easy to kill. PCs with halfway decent DV should not have a problem.<p>

<li><b>jellies</b> - Jellies can be troublesome due to several of their attacks -
sickness, acid, poison, paralyzation, etc. Gray oozes and ochre jellies will corrode
weapons made of iron, mithril and adamantium or damage the PC with their acidic attacks
when fighting unarmed. Gloves will be immediately destroyed. Mithril and adamantium
weapons are more resistant to corrosion, but it will happen eventually - do not attempt
to clear a jelly pit in melee with weapons made of iron (especially), mithril or adamantium.
This can be problematic for a low level PC. Spells or missiles are preferable, but if a
low level PC must melee these critters, stone weapons are a good choice since they do not
corrode. Alternatively, the PC can wield a si and bash the jelly with it. As an artifact,
the si cannot be damaged. PCs that are acid resistant will take no damage unarmed.<p>

Gelatinous cubes can be particularly annoying because of their ability
to destroy items that are lying on the ground. Losing that waterproof
blanket in the SMC to one of these ugly blobs is extremely frustrating.
Easily killed with missiles, spells and Mindcraft (!?).<p>

One of the nastier jellies is the stone ooze. The paralysis attack of
these can be very, very nasty for PC's who have no means of paralyzation
resistance (such as an amulet of free action). Attack them from a
distance or run away.<p>

<li><b>karmic lizards</b> - See the section above.<p>

<li><b>pixies</b> - These have an annoying habbit to steal most of the gold
your PC is carrying, then teleport away. Wear money belt to prevent stealing.
They are not dangerous otherwise.
</ul><p>

<a name="0952"></a><h4>0.9.5.2 Midgame</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>worms</b> - Worms are a group of breeding monsters of various colors that may 
pose significant annoyance and even danger to the PC. Their main threat is that they 
multiply very quickly and, if killed in large numbers, tend to become significantly 
stronger - see <a href="adomgb-0-9.html#097">0.9.7</a>.<p>

The following is a quick overview of the worms in the game and the abilities they possess:
<ul>
    <li> red worms: can breathe low-damage fire which may destroy items, immune to fire
    <li> white worms: nothing remarkable
    <li> green worms: may cause sickness
    <li> brown worms: may cause paralysis
    <li> purple worms: may cause poison 
</ul><p>

<li><b>dopplegangers</b> - These are frustrating because they deflect missiles and cause
 confusion. Doppleganger lords are somewhat more dangerous. Doppleganger kings are 
exceptionally dangerous even for very experienced PCs: they reflect the nature of the PC 
exactly in terms of DV and PV and may inflict substantially more damage than the PC is 
capable of dealing. Their speed is also nearly identical to the PC's although movement 
cost and hitpoints are not copied. Normal dopplegangers are easily killed with spells 
or Mindcraft. All dopplegangers share an inherent weakness: they are helpless in the 
dark. If the PC can create Darkness, from the spell, the scroll or the crystal, 
dopplegangers are easily killed in melee.<p>

<li><b>Dorn beasts</b> - Annoying because of their constant paralysis attack. An amulet of 
 free action will solve this problem. Less well known is the tactic 
 of attacking them in darkness or while blind. A recent report 
 suggests attacking them with missiles. Their paralysis attack does 
 not seem to engage when using missile weapons.<p>
 
<li><b>invisible stalkers</b> - They are what their name implies: invisible. You won't know
what is attacking, only after it is killed you will find an invisible stalker in the kill list.
Unless the PC has the See Invisible intrinsic of course. The message "You feel something
passing very closely besides your head!" or "Something hits you!" means an invisible monster just attacked
and possibly hit the PC. If the PC moves into an invisible monster, you get either "You swing at the air!" or
"You hit something!" message. Besides invisible stalkers, only ogre magi and some uniques will cast Invisibility
on themselves, but no other monster (except late Khelavaster and Andor Drakon) has intrinsic invisibility. 
Fighting these in a corridor would be a good tactic if the PC does not have access to the See Invisible intrinsic.<p>

<li><b>mimics</b> - These annoying creatures can appear in a shop when the player is 
 least expecting it (although they do not seem to show up in 
 Terinyo or Lawenilothehl, thankfully, they *do* appear in the HMV 
 shop - a warning for players that elect to descend through the UD 
 to start the game). By the time the PC encounters them, they can 
 generally be killed; they are simply surprising and startling. 
 One is almost guaranteed in Waldenbrook's shop. Note that tension 
 rooms full of mimics, master mimics and mimic hiveminds are much 
 more dangerous than a single mimic in a shop. They have a paralyzing hit. <p>

<LI><b>ogre magi</b> - See the section on invisible stalkers above. On the top of being invisible most
of the time, ogre magi also posses moderately powerful ice based ranged attack. Have See Invisible intrinsic,
cold resistance, a ring of fire equipped, and the PC should have no problem dispatching ogre magi.<p>

<li><b>ratling duelists</b> - Very annoying in melee thanks to their disarm ability. Have at least weapon mastery
 or use missiles/magic, if you want to avoid dropping your primary weapon.
You will continue fighting unarmed if not paying attention. 
Alternatively, non-standard weapons (say, a statue) cannot be disarmed.
Ratling duelists and especially later, ratling fencers and warlords, are not to be underestimated. They are fast, dodge attacks 
often, and have multiple attacks which ignore PV. Ratling duelists always drop gauntlets when killed.<p>

<li><b>rust monsters</b> - These beasts will rust the PC's vulnerable armor and weapons. 
 Extremely annoying, since all they have to do is touch the PC and 
 a perfectly functioning sword of sharpness or phase dagger can be 
 reduced to a useless hunk of metal. They can be pacified by 
 throwing metal items at them. Quarrels are a good choice if the 
 PC has some expendable ones. Their brethren, large rust monsters 
 and giant rust monsters, unfortunately cannot be pacified in this
 way. <p>
 
 <li><b>vampires</b> - Vampires can be annoying due their ability to drain Strength and
 Toughness. They hit quite often. Again, missiles or magic is preferable. <p>

<li><b>vortices</b> - There are four types: fire, ice, acid and lightning. All will explode when
		near the PC and always do a significant damage, both to the PC's HP and 
		equipment - regardless of DV and PV. On encounter, equip the PC with the appropriate 
    resistance if possible. Fire and ice vortices are efficiently
		dispatched by cold based or fire based spells respectively. Killing them from 
		distance or in one hit is recommended,	though it may not be easy to achieve. 
		Being at full HP is as well recommended strategy. Darkness could be very useful,
		since it seems vortices won't explode in darkness.
</ul><p>

<a name="0953"></a><h4>0.9.5.3 Late game</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>gorgons</b> - These are very dangerous because of their petrifying attack. By the way,
petrification means death. Do not eat a gorgon's corpse unless the PC is wearing an amulet of petrification
resistance! (or has petrification resistance intrinsic). High DV allows the PC to avoid gorgon's breath.<p>

<li><b>emperor lichs</b> - Emperor lichs are trouble. An exception to the general rule in 
 this section, these annoying monsters are quite capable of killing 
 a PC quickly. They cast Death Ray, so resistance is essential. 
 They see invisible, are stat drainers and are summoners. A group 
 of emperor lichs, such as those found in greater undead vaults, is 
 a challenge even for level 50 PCs who have won the game. They are 
 vulnerable to high effectivity fire spells. Improved Fireball 
 with effectivity +20 or more and willpower 48 or greater is a 
 spellcaster PC's friend against emperor lichs.<p>

<li><b>molochs</b> - Molochs, and their larger brethren Greater Molochs, are a significant 
 threat. Their melee attack can be for 100 HP or significantly more 
 in the case of GMs. They fall into the annoying category because it 
 is possible to run away from them with any PC that has halfway decent 
 speed. They typically have a speed in the 60-70 range.<p>
 
<li><b>quicklings</b> - These are very, very fast. Regular quicklings and quickling queens will employ hit and run tactic.
Quickling lords and kings use dark elven quarrels. They all try to avoid bolt spells by returning to a position where they cannot be hit, if possible.
Quickling kings and queens see invisible. Quickling queens have very strong poison attack, so it may be necessary to deal with poison damage
even if the PC has poison resistance. All quicklings regenerate health. Since they try to avoid melee and bolt magic, they are most easily
killed with missiles, or in a corridor.<p>
 
<li><b>titans</b> - Titans and greater titans are very powerful late game monsters. They have excellent health, defense, damage output and speed.
They shoot eternium quarrels. They see invisible. A threat room full of titans could prove a significant challenge to
even the most advanced PC's. Do not compare these to giants or ogres. Titans are *much* stronger.
</ul><p>

<a name="096"></a><h4>0.9.6 Weapon status - blessed, uncursed, cursed</h4>
The damage inflicted on an opponent that falls into the demon or undead category is 
dependent on the weapon's blessed vs uncursed vs cursed status. The formulas are as follows:<p>
<ul>
<li>For blessed weapons, inflicted damage = (normal damage * 1.5) - PV
<li>For uncursed weapons, inflicted damage = (normal damage * 1.0) - PV
<li>For cursed weapons, inflicted damage = (normal damage * 0.5) - PV
</ul>

Cursed weapons also seem to be more prone to breakage. Blessed weapons seem to be less 
prone to breakage.<p>

<a name="097"></a><h4>0.9.7 Monsters gain experience level - the uberjackal effect</h4>
Monsters gain xp level when the PC is killing them. It means if you manage to 
kill a number of rats, the next generated rat will have higher xp level. Rarer 
creatures require fewer kills to raise their xp level, a minimum is 5. For 
example, orcs require 75 kills, rats and giant rats 50 kills, jackals 12 kills - avoid killing lots of those by any means! Exceptions are breeders, who never gain xp. Monsters gain:
<ul>
<li>PV +2 per 3 levels
<li>DV +1 per 5 levels
<li>number of attacks +1 per 10 levels
<li>damage +1 per 3 levels 
<li>random HP increase proportional to level
</ul><p>

<a name="098"></a><h4>0.9.8 Gaining experience</h4>
High Learning increases experience gains. For every 1 xp gained (remainders are accounted for exactly, 
there is no rounding loss), the PC gains Le/1000 bonus xp. 
The Good Learner and Great Learner talents increase xp too. Good Learner alone is 150%, Good Learner + Great Learner is 120%. 
Remainders are accounted for incorrectly and there is rounding loss for many small kills.<p>
 
The experience gained per killing a monster is dependent on Speed of both combatants according to the following formula:<p>
Exp_gained = base_exp * (monster_speed / PC_speed)<p>
This means lowering PC's speed as well as increasing monster speed before delivering the final hit are means of generating
more experience. This is most commonly achieved by repeatedly casting Slow Monster spell at the PC.
Beware however,
there is a limit on maximum xp gain. Going beyond the limit will yield only 1 xp.<p>
Besides killing monsters, experience can be gained via disarming traps. A fraction experience (1/20) is gained 
when offering piece and when sacrificing monsters at an altar. 
There is no other known way of gaining experience.<p>

<a name="099"></a><h4>0.9.9 Spellcasting monsters</h4>
Not only the PC, but also some monsters are able to cast spells. However, the spell
selection for monsters is very different, as is monster spell mechanics.
Spellcasting monsters do not use the PP and spell knowledge/power system PC uses.  
There are three classes of monster spells: directed spells, touch attack spells,
and non-directed spells, and two monster spellcaster's properties: spell range and 
spell power.<p>

<a name="0991"></a><h4>0.9.9.1 Spell ranges</h4>
Directed spells have a range which is a property of the monster spellcaster. This range is the 
same for all directed spells, and is generally square; beware of diagonals. 
High level monsters gain 1 spell range per 4 levels. Chaotic and lawful spellcasters 
have one third less range on Silvernight and Darknight, respectively. Base ranges 
are a function of spellcaster type as follows:<p>

<table border=1><caption>Spell ranges</caption>

</td></tr></table><p>

<a name="0992"></a><h4>0.9.9.2 Spell powers</h4>
The damage of spells is determined by another parameter of the monster, the spell power. 
Every additional level gives a monster +1 spell power; 
chaotic and lawful spellcasters get one third more 
spell power on Darknight or Silvernight respectively.<p>

<a name="0993"></a><h4>0.9.9.3 Directed spells</h4>
These spells can be cast at range. Monsters will still use them in melee sometimes.<p>

<a name="09931"></a><h4>0.9.9.3.1 Energy bolt / Death ray</h4>
The Death Ray spell, described as an "energy bolt", attempts to instantly kill the target. 
It is a dodgable spell and has finite range. Even if it hits, the target still may make a 
saving throw and may have resistance; in either case, damage is done instead. There is no 
multiple death ray resistance. The damage done by a resisted death ray is equal to 
Xd3+Y where X = Max(15, spell power) and Y is 1d(spell power)-1. The PC will save 
on a (Mana + Luck) in spell power chance.<p>

<a name="09932"></a><h4>0.9.9.3.2 Stream of energy</h4>
This is a simple non-elemental damage spell. It is displayed as a yellow line 
segment and described as a "painful stream of energy", or "strong magical energies" 
when affecting monsters. It has finite range and can be dodged when affecting the PC; 
against monsters, it can be shrugged like a bolt spell, with attack power equal to 
spell power. It does (spell power+2)d4 damage.<p>

<a name="09933"></a><h4>0.9.9.3.3 Confusion</h4>
This spell attempts to confuse its target. There is no path requirement; if the caster 
can see the PC and the PC is in range, it is fair game regardless of angle or anything in the middle. 
For monsters, success is based on a spell range and level, duration is Max(1, spell power/4)d2; 
for PC the maths are much more involved and not worth detailing here in prose. Chance to 
resist Confusion depends mainly on Willpower, with an effective +6 Willpower bonus per properly 
equipped -Conf item. Luck is also added to effective Willpower. Confusion duration depends mostly 
on -Conf items, but there is a small Willpower influence; Wi from 10 to 40 reduces average duration 
by 20% (no effect on maximum).<p>

<a name="09934"></a><h4>0.9.9.3.4 Glowing Balls / Magic Missile</h4>
This is attack spell which targets like an arrow. It is dodgable, and can be shrugged by 
exactly as a bolt spell. It displays as a blue * and is described as glowing 
balls, but in the endgame dump is named as magic missiles, leading many to beleive it 
non-elemental, but it actually does fire damage; it speeds up Drakelings, can melt beeswax, 
and is reduced significantly by fire resistance (divided by 1 + 6 if intrinsic, + 3 per item).
Base damage is (spell power/2)d6.<p>

<a name="09935"></a><h4>0.9.9.3.5 Cone of cold</h4>
Works like glowing balls, but deals cold damage. Displays white *.<p>

<a name="09936"></a><h4>0.9.9.3.6 Shock bolt</h4>
Works like glowing balls, but deals lightning damage. Displays yellow *.<p>

<a name="09937"></a><h4>0.9.9.3.7 Avoiding directed spells</h4>
Your ability to avoid spells is not affected by DV, tactics, what you're avoiding, 
or even the level of the caster. There are five checks to evade spells; only one of 
them needs to pass. Most of the checks are much harder in the dark. First, you 
will avoid a spell on a (Dx + Luck) in (Dx + 50 (120 in dark)) chance. Second, 
you will avoid a spell on a (Mana + Luck) in 1000 
check. The third check only applies if your speed is greater than 100; you have 
a (speed - 100) in 100 (200 in darkness) chance to avoid spells, capped one short 
of perfection (99% or 99.5%). Thus, if speed is boosted above 200, or 300 for 
darkfighting, effective immunity to bolts is achieved; this is useful to remember 
against dangerous spellcasters. Finally come the skill checks. Fourth is a straight 
Dodge in 1000 (2000 if darkness) check. Finally, an Alertness check with a difficulty 
of 200 (400) is made. Since Alertness is a [+] skill, multiple checks are possible 
at high skill values; at 100, Alertness negates 7/8 of bolts that get this far. 
With 99 Dexterity, 200 speed, and 100 Alertness, 1 in 2400 spells will connect.<p> 

<a name="0994"></a><h4>0.9.9.4 Touch attack spells</h4>
These spells can only be used in melee range, so avoiding them is easy - just stay 
out of range.<p>

<a name="09941"></a><h4>0.9.9.4.1 Drain stat</h4>
Monsters will only use Drain stat against the PC, never other monsters. 
If successful, one random stat is lowered by 1d3 permanently. <p>

The Drain stat spell is used by the following spellcasters: black druid,
great white wyrm,
greater daemon, 	
lich king, 	
emperor lich, 	
old crone, 
minotaur mage, 	
multi-headed chaos dragon,
Chaos Archmage, ElDeR cHaOs GoD, ancient sage.<p> 	 

<a name="09942"></a><h4>0.9.9.4.2 Curse</h4>
This spell will only be used by monsters against the PC, and has two possible results. 
An item is selected from inventory completely at random. If the PC has have no items, 
or gold is the item chosen, the PC himself will be subjected to the curse; otherwise, 
the chosen item will. If the PC already has the Cursed
intrinsic, there is 16.7% chance to gain the Doomed intrinsic instead.<p>

The Curse spell is used by the following spellcasters: black druid, 
quickling bard, 
great black wyrm, 	
black wizard, green hag, 
annis hag, master lich, 
lich king, 
emperor lich, 
old crone, 
minotaur mage, 
multi-headed chaos dragon, 
Chaos Archmage, ElDeR cHaOs GoD, ancient sage.<p>

<a name="09943"></a><h4>0.9.9.4.3 Teleport other</h4>
Pretty self-explanatory effects, equivalent to zapping a wand of teleportation.
Against monsters, only a level-dependent save is used; low-level monsters will almost never 
resist. In principle this provides a way to teleport Khelavaster off the stairs; 
sadly, the monster AI will never make attacks against dying sages. No effect on non-teleport levels.<p>

The Teleport other spell is used by the following spellcasters: druid, quickling bard, 
fairy dragon, 
old crone, 	
Chaos Archmage, ElDeR cHaOs GoD, ancient sage.<p> 

<a name="09944"></a><h4>0.9.9.4.4 Avoiding touch attack spells</h4>
The PC avoids Stat drain or "Curse the PC" spells if Luck + 1dMa-1 >= 1d(spell power-1). 
Therefore, high Mana and Luck are extremely beneficial, but cannot provide 
enough safety from these.<p>

Curse item and Teleport other use easier save. They are avoided if 1d(spell power)-1 > Mana+Luck.
Thus, high Mana can make your PC safe from item curses; 
the Mana needed in this way must be equal to the relevant spell power. With 25 or higher Mana, 
any item is safe from all cursing monsters that are not also stat drainers 
(if the PC has positive Luck, and it is not Darknight).<p>

<a name="0995"></a><h4>0.9.9.5 Non-targetted spells</h4>
These spells do not require an enemy at all.

<a name="09951"></a><h4>0.9.9.5.1 Invisibility</h4>
Turns the user invisible for (spell power / 2)d4 turns. Used by ogre magus (4d4 turns),
cat lord (6d4 turns), and Chaos Archmage, ElDeR cHaOs GoD, ancient sage (31d4 turns).<p> 
                              
<a name="09952"></a><h4>0.9.9.5.2 Darkness</h4>
Darkens an octagonal area around the caster. Diameter is equal to spell range. 
Used by black druid (diameter 5), and Chaos Archmage, ElDeR cHaOs GoD, ancient sage (diameter 15).<p>

<a name="09953"></a><h4>0.9.9.5.3 Heal</h4>
Heals the caster up to (spell power)d5 damage, with no effect on any statuses. 
Used by priest (4d5),
black druid (6d5),
druid (13d5),
ancient karmic wyrm (22d5),
Ancient Chaos Wyrm (30d5), ancient blue wyrm (30d5), ki-rin (30d5),
old crone (40d5),
ancient sage (63d5).<p>

<a name="09954"></a><h4>0.9.9.5.4 Greater Heal</h4>

Used by ancient sage,
emperor lich,
lich,
lich king,

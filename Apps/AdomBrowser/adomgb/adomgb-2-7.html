<h3>The Dwarven Graveyard</h3>
<A HREF="adomgb-2-7-pic.html" target="blank">Click here</A> for a color map of both levels of the Dwarven Graveyard.<p>
The Dwarven Graveyard is located in the southeastern mountains of the 
wilderness map. It cannot be found until the PC talks to Thrundarr
about "portal". The portal seals the lower parts of the CoC until
the PC finishes this quest or removes Thrundarr from his location in 
Dwarftown and 'h'andles the lever controlling the portal. It is most
definitely worth doing the quest, since two artifacts can be found in 
the graveyard.<p>

There have been conflicting reports about the rewards Thrundarr 
provides for accomplishing this quest. It is always equipment,
though the status varies. Whether holy water is poured on Griff's
grave seems to make little difference in this preliminary examination:<p>

Griff destroyed in melee, no holy water poured on grave:<p>
<pre>
uncursed wand of digging (0 charges)
uncursed wand of fireballs (1 charge)
heap of 6 blessed potions of extra healing
</pre>
a different PC, same scenario:<p>
<pre>
uncursed wand of digging (5 charges)
uncursed wand of fireballs (1 charge)
heap of 3 blessed potions of extra healing
</pre>
Griff destroyed in melee, poured holy water on grave afterwards:<p>
<pre>
uncursed wand of digging (5 charges)
uncursed wand of fireballs (3 charges)
heap of 4 blessed potions of extra healing
</pre>
Griff destroyed by pouring holy water on grave:<p>
<pre>
blessed wand of digging (2 charges)
uncursed wand of fireballs (2 charges)
heap of 8 blessed potions of extra healing
</pre>
Using holy water on Griff's grave produces the message:<p>
<pre>
You pour some water on the ground. You are overcome by feelings of
gratefulness.

<a name="271"></a><h4>2.7.1 Surface level</h4>
The surface level of the graveyard is an open plain inhabited by many, 
many undead. There are skeletons, zombies, ghuls, shadows and wights
present. This is also probably the first time the player finds graves.
See section <a href="adomgb-0-13.html#0dh">0.13.17</a> for more about 
graves and gravedigging. It is probably not worth trying to dig up the 
"great treasures" graves with a level 13-17 PC. The PC can always return 
later if desired.<p>

If the PC has a limited supply of undead slaying ammo use it very 
sparingly, if at all. It will be needed in the underground level.<p>

The center of the plain contains a small building that leads to the 
underground level.<p>

<a name="272"></a><h4>2.7.2 Underground level</h4>
The underground level of the dwarven graveyard contains a labyrinth 
which features many traps. It is very wise to have the Detect Traps
skill while navigating this maze. Use the 's'earch command constantly
if the PC has the Detect Traps skill. The left side of the screen is
the problematic area regarding traps. The right side of the screen is
Griff's tomb, which has been taken over by Nonnak, the master 
necromancer. It contains a large number of undead, including ghosts,
wraiths, Griff Bloodax the undead dwarven chaos berserker and Nonnak
himself.<p>

There are two artifacts hidden in Nonnak's lair. The elemental
gauntlets are found in a hidden room in the center of the eastern wall.  
They are guarded by a bone golem and are almost always located on a 
trap. The bone golem is not difficult to defeat for a PC that has
made it through the dwarven graveyard. The Sword of Nonnak is located
in Griff Bloodax's grave in the center of Nonnak's lair. It is
necessary to have some means of digging to retrieve it. The sword is
quite important for Wizards, Mindcrafters and other classes dependent 
upon Willpower. It grants +5 to Willpower. Note that digging up Griff's
grave to retrieve the sword is a chaotic act, like any grave digging.<p>

<a name="2721"></a><h4>2.7.2.1 Griff Bloodax</h4>
Griff Bloodax, the undead chaos dwarven berserker, is a brute force 
opponent. He does not seem to have any special attacks, though his
melee attack is formidable for a level 13 PC. Note that Griff is
teleportation resistant. Therefore simply trying to teleport him away
in order to reach his grave and 'u'se holy water will not work. Using
undead slaying ammo is very effective against him, while melee with a 
low-teens experience level PC may be difficult.<p>

<a name="2722"></a><h4>2.7.2.2 Nonnak</h4>
Nonnak is the master necromancer that created the undead guarding the 
tomb. He is vulnerable to fire-based attacks. He uses Frost Bolt as
an offensive spell and has a mediocre melee attack. PCs without cold
resistance will have a very hard time defeating him. He is also a summoner.
Note that both Griff Bloodax and Nonnak must be dead to fulfill Thrundarr's
quest.<p>

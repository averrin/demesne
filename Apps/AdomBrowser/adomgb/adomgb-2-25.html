<h3>The Infinite Dungeon</h3>
The Infinite Dungeon is found in the southeastern part of the wilderness map. 
Prior to entering it, the description is "A tiny, strangely distorted cave 
entry."<p>

The Infinite Dungeon (ID) is truly infinite for all practical purposes. The 
level number is limited by some 32 or 64 bit integer value, but who really 
cares about that? It would take many lifetimes to descend through all its
levels, even assuming a PC could survive such a trip, which is impossible.  
The danger level increases with dungeon level; any level greater than 200 or 
so becomes ridiculous.<p>

The ID has some unique characteristics: shops, altars and pools are never 
generated. Every dungeon level is randomly generated, so leaving a level and 
reentering it results in a completely new dungeon level. There is one special
level, the SIL, where MaLaKaI resides.<p>

According to the Mad Minstrel, the ID was originally a monument built by the 
powers of law. The incursion of Chaos into Ancardia has twisted it into its
current condition.<p>

Any non-hostile mobs, including Filk, that you <i>lose</i> in the ID will 
re-appear later in the wilderness to meet up with you.<p>

<b>Stair-hopping</b> (thanks to gut for this section)<p>
Stair hopping is the process of repeatedly ascending and descending a single
staircase in the ID, for the purpose of generating hordes of items in the
continuously generated rooms. Items generated on the ID's floors will be of a
danger level equal to 1/3 of the ID's dungeon level. That means only DL1 items
will be generated on ID levels 1-3. On ID levels 4-6, DL2 items can be generated,
and DL3 items can be generated on ID levels 7-10. This applies to dipping items
into potions of raw chaos and exchange as well. This does not apply to guaranteed
drops, like eternium gear from chaos warriors. Also, it seems that this does
not always apply to monster generation either.<p>

Benefits of stair hopping include: An easy way to acquire spellbooks, as they are
all DL1, and thus available on ID levels 1-3. An easy way to acquire extra DV/PV
points for the early game, as shields, hats, gauntlets, boots, etc... can sometimes
have nice stats. An easy source of teleport control (actually the only guaranteed
source of TP control in the game), as blink dogs can be found after ID 4 (sometimes
earlier). An easy way to aquire potions and scrolls that can save a PC's life.<p>

<a name="2p1"></a><h4>2.25.1 Filk</h4>
Filk is found in the ID on the level corresponding to the number of 
first-killed monsters killed. For example if the first monster killed was a
rat and 225 rats have been killed, Filk will be found on I: 225. Filk is a 
quickling bard and the fastest quickling in the game with a speed of 1500.  
His DV/PV is 500/0. He shares the properties of karmics although he is not
named as such. More about obtaining the Filk quest is found in section
<a href="adomgb-4.html#4311">4.3.1.1</a>.<p>

<a name="2p2"></a><h4>2.25.2 MaLaKaI</h4>
MaLaKaI resides in the SIL, found at level 66 of the ID. He is a chaos 
knight and guards the Sceptre of Chaos. The SIL is not really part of the
ID. It is discovered by descending through the ID normally, but once left, 
it can never be found again. This means if a PC needs the Sceptre of Chaos,
there is only one chance to get it, so be prepared. MaLaKaI is quite tough.
He is designed to be an opponent for characters above level 40. He has a
corrupting melee attack. He cannot see in Darkness and is vulnerable to humanoid
and demon slaying weapons and ammo.<p>

Conclusive proof that the SIL is not part of the ID is the fact that altars 
are sometimes generated in the SIL. These can come in very handy since
MaLaKaI can be sacrificed.<p>

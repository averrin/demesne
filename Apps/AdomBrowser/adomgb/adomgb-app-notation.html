<h3>Notation for item appendices</h3>
<b>Most items are listed with the "common" group, then the "noble" group
(expensive metals and the like), then artifacts. + denotes an artifact
which is obtained through game plot, * an artifact which is obtained
randomly. H(+x, mdn) denotes hand-to-hand damage, M() missile damage.
Effect abilities conferred are abbreviated. +Tele means "grants
teleportation", -Fire means "fire resistance", =Fire (two lines, get it?) means
"fire immunity". Slaying powers are denoted by !. Bad items are in
<font color="red">red</font>. Most items are listed with their unidentified
appearance. If this appearance is shown in (), that means the appearance is
not always the same, but the "associated" or "most common" appearance. For
expendable magical items (wands, scrolls etc, not worn equipment) imagine
that ALL appearances are listed in ().
ALL STATISTICS ARE "BASE" NUMBERS AND CAN BE ADJUSTED UP OR DOWN AS THE
ITEM APPEARS: base odds for a chance of +/- variation for item generation is 15%. 
This goes up (as high as 40%) depending on the difference between the DL PC is on 
and the DL of the item. There is further 10% chance of deviating from the standard 
+/- 1-3 variation, but this also requires the DL difference to be high enough and 
at least one further 1/3 check passed (more 1/3 checks passed = more deviation).</b><p>

As always, corrections are invited.<p>

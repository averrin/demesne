<h3>Special Endings</h3>
<a name="41"></a><h4>4.1 Andor Drakon</h4>
Andor Drakon is the ElDeR cHaOs GoD, the source of all the trouble in 
Ancardia. He resides on the ChAoS plane, which lies beyond the chaos
gate. Any PC who wants to attempt a special ending will have to face
him. The requirements for passing through the chaos gate vary according
to alignment and whether the PC wants to attempt the normal chaos god 
ending or an ultra ending, and are detailed in the sections regarding 
the endings.<p>

It is a good idea to remove the Chaos artifacts necessary for gate passage 
immediately upon arrival on the ChAoS plane. Furthermore, drop them.
They are no longer needed and only serve to further corrupt the PC, which 
is going to happen rapidly anyway because of the corrupting nature of the 
ChAoS plane.  Read all scrolls of chaos resistance. Drink all potions of
cure corruption.<p>

Andor Drakon is, as might be imagined, a formidable enemy. He is 
fast, with a speed of 217 the last time it was checked several gammas 
ago. He is invisible. He casts what are apparently death rays, has
a corrupting melee attack in addition to the naturally corrupting chaos 
plane, paralyzes, summons (writhing masses of primal chaos are a favorite),
casts Darkness, teleports and drains stats and power points at a fearsome rate.<p>

His speed was gleaned from the Monster Memory which is otherwise not 
helpful, stating that he is beyond description. He also seems to be 
immune to the effects of a blessed stethoscope.<p>

How to deal with him? Have a massively powerful melee attack. Drink all stat
boosting potions prior to gate entry. Be very, very fast, the faster the better,
preferably speed should be intrinsically above 200 and boosted above 400. Have
excellent PV and DV. Have every resistance possible. If the PC is not paralyzation
resistant, an amulet of free action (or the Boots of the Divine Messenger, for
instance) is essential. A light source is essential. He is vulnerable to demon
and humanoid slaying weapons and ammo. If the PC sticks with missiles, Andor
Drakon cannot corrupt by touch, paralyze or drain stats. If the PC is out of
direct line his Death Rays cannot be used.<p>

He has been killed in many different ways, including using the Acid Ball spell
in a previous gamma version of the game. Relying on spells on the ChAoS plane
is not currently recommended, since Andor Drakon now drains PP very rapidly and
claims that using magic strengthens him. In practice casting spells makes
him faster (speed +spellcost/5). A wand of fireballs or crystals of fire are handy for removing the
hordes of writhing masses of primal chaos he will probably summon.<p>

Chaotics should avoid prayer on the ChAoS plane. It causes greater balors to be summoned.<p>

If a PC has much trouble on D: 50, it does not bode well as far as 
defeating Andor Drakon goes. He often defeats PC's who have *no* 
trouble on D: 50 (but are perhaps not as spoiled as those reading this).<p>

Monsters generated on the ChAoS Plane are:
chaos brother,       
chaos sister,
chaos warlord,
chaos warrior,
corruptor,
writhing mass of primal chaos (quadruple chance),
chaos plague bearer,
chaos rat,
balor,
chaos lizard,
chaos mutant (double chance),
chaos spawn (double chance),
chaos wizard,
chaos eye.<p>
 
<a name="42"></a><h4>4.2 The Chaos God ending</h4>
The Chaos God ending was the first special ending available in ADOM, as of gamma 6 (?).
Today it has become kind of old-fashioned. Victory posts with "ordinary" Chaos Gods 
are few and far between. One reason it has fallen out of favor is because the future 
history of the PC after winning is bleak: after going to all the trouble necessary to 
even meet, much less defeat Andor Drakon, the PC revels in his glory for some time but 
is ultimately vanquished by a Champion of Law. Still, it is the only means of 
accessing a special ending if Khelavaster cannot be saved, which is very difficult.  
It is also the only way to achieve a special ending with a pure chaotic: a PC that 
starts chaotic and stays that way for the entire game. That in itself is quite an 
accomplishment.<p>

<a name="421"></a><h4>4.2.1 Requirements</h4>
In order to achieve the Chaos God ending the PC must meet several requirements. These are
checked during passage through the Chaos Gate. He must be C-. He must be a crowned Champion
of Chaos. He must be extremely corrupted (the game will inform you when the PC is extremely
corrupted). If these criteria are not met, the PC is shredded to pieces by any of several
guardians or the millions of Chaos denizens Andor Drakon has collected (the exact guardian
who kills the PC will have to wait for further testing, however, from memory, it is something
like multi-tentacled horrors of unspeakable might check C- alignment, a chaos knight checks
for crowned Champion of Chaos and says "I bow before thee, my lord!" if the requirement is
met and the millions of Chaos denizens check the requirement for extremely corrupted; a
successful check causes them to chant "One of us! One of us!"). Further, the PC must have
the Chaos Trinity properly equipped: wear the Crown and Medal of Chaos, wield the Sceptre
of Chaos in the right hand, leave the left hand empty. If this requirement is not met, Andor
Drakon blasts the PC to oblivion. A successful check results in a message from Andor Drakon
along the lines of "You seem to be wearing the insignia correctly. iT wIlL bE a PlEaSuRe To
ShReD yOu In MeLeE!" If all of this is met, the PC winds up on the ChAoS plane to face Andor
Drakon. Despite the fact that wielding the Sceptre of Chaos is required for Gate entry, in
ADOM 1.1.1 it is not necessary for the PC to be wielding it when Andor Drakon is killed
(unlike the TotRR in the ultra endings below). Since it is a corrupting artifact, it may
be wise to discard it immediately upon arrival on the ChAoS plane.<p>

<a name="422"></a><h4>4.2.2 The Chaos God ending step by step</h4>
<ul>
<li>While chaotic, give six artifacts to the demented ratling and get the location of the Stone Circle - <a href="adomgb-2-5.html#258">2.5.8</a>
<li>Go to the Stone Circle and kill the multi-headed chaos dragon and get the Crown of Chaos - <a href="adomgb-2-23.html">2.23</a>
<li>While chaotic, talk to the old crone and give her the following items: a giant boar skull, a scroll of danger, 
a potion of cure corruption, a wand of monster creation, and a farmer corpse. Receive the Medal of Chaos - <a href="adomgb-2-21.html#2l6">2.21.6</a>
<li>Kill MaLaKaI on level 66 of the Infinite Dungeon, and get the Sceptre of Chaos - <a href="adomgb-2-25.html#2p2">2.25.2</a>
<li>Get crowned as champion of Chaos
<li>Fight your way to the Chaos Gate on D:50 - <a href="adomgb-3-13.html">3.13</a>
<li>Be extremely corrupted (16 or more corruptions)
<li>While wearing the Crown of Chaos and the Medal of Chaos, and wielding the Sceptre of Chaos, enter the Chaos Gate
<li>Kill Andor Drakon - <a href="adomgb-4.html#41">4.1</a>
</ul><p>

<a name="43"></a><h4>4.3 Ultra endings</h4>
The Ultra endings were available as of gamma ten. In this gamma, the restriction on Chaos Gate
entry for chaotics only was removed. However, the PC needs to have a mythical and long searched-for
weapon - the Trident of the Red Rooster (TotRR). The steps necessary to obtain it are listed below.<p>

All PCs attempting an Ultra ending must procure the Crown of Chaos and Medal of Chaos. In order
to receive the quests for the Medal of Chaos from Gaab'Baay the PC must be at some flavor of chaotic
alignment. There are six quests total, the first of which is to "satisfy the mutated one" which refers
to completing the demented ratling's demand for six artifacts. The demented ratling will also only talk
to chaotics. The demented ratling reveals the secret of the Stone Circle, where Keriax, the multi-headed
chaos dragon who holds the Crown of Chaos resides. After receiving the Medal of Chaos, the PC is free to
change alignment, since the Stone Circle can be entered regardless of alignment. Remember the PC must
change back to at least some flavor of neutral alignment in order to retrieve the TotRR. Khelavaster
will not summon the TotRR for chaotics.<p>

All of the above has another implication - the PC cannot be crowned until the Medal of Chaos (or the TotRR
itself, if an Ultimate Chaos God ending is planned) is obtained. Fallen champions will never receive the
TotRR nor survive passage through the Chaos gate, so the nice benefits of crowning must be deferred until
the Medal of Chaos or TotRR are obtained.<p>

<a name="431"></a><h4>4.3.1 The Trident of the Red Rooster</h4>
The Trident of the Red Rooster is the ultimate weapon available in ADOM. Its 
characteristics can be found in <a href="adomgb-app-L.html">Appendix L</a>, but more importantly, it allows passage 
through the Chaos Gate regardless of alignment. Retrieving it is a lengthy process 
outlined below.<p>

<a name="4311"></a><h4>4.3.1.1 The Filk quest</h4>
The Filk quest is available from the Assassin Prince, on behalf of the Mad Minstrel, 
once three requirements are met. They are: the PC is at least experience level 45 (Assasins are exception, they must only be at least level 30), the 
PC has successfully taken Sharad-Waador's quest and slain Srraxxarrakex and the PC has 
in his possession the artifact dagger Needle which is one of the rewards Sharad-Waador 
provides for killing Srraxxarrakex. After receiving the quest, the PC may elect to kill 
the Assassin Prince since he carries Needle's companion dagger Sting. Dual-wielded, 
they are enormously powerful. The object of the quest is to kill Filk, a named quickling 
bard.<p>

The Assassin Prince gives some cryptic hints provided by the Mad Minstrel about Filk's 
location. They mean that Filk can be found on the level of the ID corresponding to the 
number of first-killed monsters killed. Note that this number can change as the quest 
proceeds. As a quickling, he is obviously fast, but Filk is the fastest of them all 
with a speed of 1500. When attacking Filk, note two things: he has the highest DV of 
any monster in the game at 500 but a PV of zero. Needless to say he is difficult to hit.  
However, once he is hit he is easily killed. He also shares the properties of karmics, 
although he is not named as such. Use missiles, wands, spells, Mindcraft or companions 
to kill him.<p>

<a name="4312"></a><h4>4.3.1.2 The Mad Minstrel</h4>
After the Filk quest is completed, the PC should visit the Mad Minstrel. He will 
provide access to and information about the location of the Scintillating Cave (found 
in the western part of the wilderness south of the RotHK caves very close to the Ruined 
City).<p>

<a name="4313"></a><h4>4.3.1.3 The Scintillating Cave</h4>
The Scintillating Cave consists of eight cavernous levels. As one of the last places 
the PC will visit, it is dangerous and has a high generation rate featuring very 
dangerous monsters. Ancient Karmic Dragons, Greater Molochs and Emperor Lichs are 
common. It is best to simply get to the down staircases as quickly as possible unless 
the PC is an absolute walking tank by this time (which some aspiring to Ultra endings 
are). The objective is to find the down staircase to the lair of the Emperor Moloch.<p>

<a name="43131"></a><h4>4.3.1.3.1 The Emperor Moloch</h4>
By this time the PC has probably faced Greater Molochs and can imagine what the Emperor
Moloch will be like. Extraordinary PV, not much DV, slow and hits like a ton of bricks.
In addition, the level he resides on is massively corrupting. He must be killed quickly
or lured off the level. He is vulnerable to phase daggers, ball spells, high effectivity
bolt spells, demon slaying missiles including the rune-covered trident (although it is
not guaranteed to return) and greater telekinetic blast. The twin daggers are not effective.
When killed, he drops two guaranteed items: the crumpled scroll and a moloch armor weighing
15000 stones(!). The crumpled scroll is the key to the TotRR. The crumpled scroll is not an
artifact and just as susceptible as any scroll to damage. The PC should read it as soon as
possible. It is then possible to recreate it with a magical writing set.<p>

<a name="4314"></a><h4>4.3.1.4 Khelavaster in Terinyo</h4>
At this stage in the game Khelavaster can be found in Terinyo. He is invisible. When 
given the crumpled scroll, he will summon the TotRR. Remember the PC must be of 
neutral or lawful alignment.<p>

<a name="432"></a><h4>4.3.2 The Avatar of Order ending</h4>
To finish this ending the following requirements must be met: the PC enters the Chaos Gate
as a crowned L+ Champion of Law wearing the Crown and Medal of Chaos and wielding the TotRR.
The PC must not be intrinsically doomed or cursed other than due to wearing the Chaos artifacts.
There is no corruption requirement. Kill Andor Drakon while wielding the TotRR. If the TotRR
is not wielded when Andor Drakon dies, the ChAoS energies released by his death overwhelm the
PC, turning him into a miserable ChAoS wretch. Avoid this. ;-)<p>

Note that it is possible for
a prospective Avatar of Order to become a fallen champion on the ChAoS plane, kill Andor Drakon
while wielding the TotRR, and instead become an Avatar of his current alignment, despite not
being crowned. This is one way around the corruption requirement for the Avatar of Balance
and UCG endings. However, the PC must be able to change alignment on the ChAoS plane while
fighting Andor Drakon, easier said than done.<p>

<a name="433"></a><h4>4.3.3 The Avatar of Balance ending</h4>
To finish this ending the following requirements must be met: the PC enters the Chaos Gate as a
crowned N= Champion of Balance wearing the Crown and Medal of Chaos and wielding the TotRR. The
PC must not be intrinsically doomed or cursed other than due to wearing the Chaos artifacts. The
PC must be extremely corrupted (the game will inform you when the PC is extremely corrupted).
Kill Andor Drakon while wielding the TotRR. If the TotRR is not wielded when Andor Drakon dies,
the ChAoS energies released by his death overwhelm the PC, turning him into a miserable ChAoS
wretch. Avoid this. ;-).<p>

<a name="434"></a><h4>4.3.4 The Ultimate Chaos God ending</h4>
To finish this ending the following requirements must be met: the PC enters the Chaos Gate as a
crowned C- Champion of Chaos wearing the Crown and Medal of Chaos and wielding the TotRR. The
PC must not be intrinsically doomed or cursed other than due to wearing the Chaos artifacts.
The PC must be extremely corrupted (the game will inform you when the PC is extremely corrupted).
Kill Andor Drakon while wielding the TotRR.<p>

<h3>The Wilderness</h3>
<a href="adomgb-1-6-pic.html" target="blank">Click here</a> for a color map of the wilderness.<p>
The wilderness is the overland map of the Drakalor Chain. It is often
regarded as a curse by new players, whose PC's are killed in wilderness 
encounters and have difficulty keeping their PCs fed during treks across 
the wilderness. Advanced players with PCs who are well equipped to deal
with the wilderness regard it as a wonderful resource.<p>

The Survival skill can be useful for lengthy stays in the wilderness, but 
note that applying it wastes a lot of game time.<p>

<a name="161"></a><h4>1.6.1 Why start the game in the Wilderness?</h4>
Many players will start the game in the wilderness, at least for the 
first kill, because the first monster killed can be controlled according 
to what type of wilderness square generates an encounter.<p>

<a name="162"></a><h4>1.6.2 Strategy and problems in the Wilderness</h4>
In order to avoid wasting too much time in the wilderness (e.g. because 
of the dreadful 90 day limit), it is good to know how long it actually 
takes to do things in the wilderness.<p>

All times are approximate since there are slight variations of some 
minutes. It is also the case that without apparent reason walking times 
are sometimes doubled. This can happen for any terrain type and might be 
a bug. Being burdened or strained does not cause this and has marginal, 
if any, effect on movement time in the wilderness.<p>

<table border=1><caption>Wilderness time</caption>
<tr><th>Time Spent <th> Action
<tr><td>nothing<td> changing body armor
<tr><td>60 min <td> changing other parts of equipment
<tr><td>60 min<td> resting
<tr><td>60 min<td> moving onto a plains, road, water, or special
 (dungeon entrance and the like) square
<tr><td>90 min <td> moving onto a hills square
<tr><td>120 min <td> moving onto a forest square
<tr><td>180 min <td> moving onto a swamp square
<tr><td>300 min <td> moving onto a mountain square (provided you own a climbing set)
<tr><td>240 min <td> applying Survival (Rangers of level 1-5 and non-Rangers)
<tr><td>120 min <td> applying Survival (Rangers of level 6-50)
</table><p>

Note that the Swimming skill and water breathing intrinsic have no effect
on the time needed to move onto a water square. Likewise, the Climbing skill
and the blessed/uncursed/cursed status of a climbing set have no effect on 
the time needed to move onto a mountain square.<p>

Note that a climbing set is required to move onto mountains. It is important 
to know the status of a climbing set, in particular making sure it is not 
cursed. A cursed climbing set will fail at the most inopportune moment. 
At a minimum, the resulting slip while mountaineering will cause extensive 
equipment destruction. It is often fatal. The blessed vs uncursed status 
seems to have little or no effect.<p>

<a name="163"></a><h4>1.6.3 The Survival skill</h4>
Successfully applying the Survival skill when not bloated increases the 
satiation value of the PC by about 100 (equivalent to 1/5 large ration, see 
<a href="adomgb-app-G.html">Appendix G</a>). 
This is roughly tripled for Rangers of level 6 or above. These 
values hold for both water and land squares.<p>

If the PC is already bloated, his satiation value isn't increased. Instead, 
he gathers plant seeds (on land squares) or goes fishing (on water squares). 
The amount of seeds gathered does not depend on terrain type or skill value 
and averages at about 5.2. Rangers of level 6 or above receive triple amount.<p>

When fishing is successful, the PC obtains exactly one piece of fish meat.<p>

The chances of success when applying the Survival skill depend on skill value, 
terrain type, the Ranger level 6 class power, and the Falcon birthsign. 
The Falcon birthsign gives a 1/3 chance of success even if you fail the initial check.
The following success rates 
were measured by applying the Survival skill 100 times, with a skill value of 
100. The "normal" column applies to non-Rangers and Rangers of level 1-5, the 
"high" column to Rangers of level 6-50. Level is the terrain difficulty level.<p>

<a name="164"></a><h4>1.6.4 Wilderness encounters</h4>
The following table specifies chance of a wilderness encounter per step in the wilderness.
The Doomed column also applies if the PC is both cursed and doomed.<p>

<table border=1><caption>Chance of an encounter</caption>
<tr><th>Terrain<th>Chance  <th>Cursed   <th>Doomed  
<tr><td>Swamp  <td>18%      <td> 48%     <td> 90%
<tr><td>Road   <td>15%       <td> 45%     <td> 75%
<tr><td>Plains <td>7.5%    <td> 22.5%     <td> 37.5%
<tr><td>Hills  <td>5%       <td> 15%       <td> 25%

<tr><td>Water  <td>0%        <td> 0%       <td>0%
</table><p>

Wilderness encounter types are specified next. If the PC is level 25+, the chance is 16.7% for high-level (lvl 25+) encounter, 33% for mid-level (lvl 15+) and 50.3% 
for low-level (lvl 1+) encounter. For lvl 15+ PC's, 33% for mid-level and 67% for high-level encounter. For level and terrain, each of the types has equal chance.<p>

</table><p>

[1] if the Kranach quest is received, PC is max level 5, has max 5000 xp, there is 25% chance of an encounter being a group of roving raiders <p>

<a name="1641"></a><h4>1.6.4.1 Chance for ambush</h4>
After the encounter is generated, 3 possible situations may occur:
<ol>
<li>you are ambushed
<li>you are given choices of ambush, evade, fight
<li>your choices are only evade or fight
</ol><p>

Case 1 cannot happen to invisible PC's, lvl 6+ Druids and lvl 25+ Merchants. For others, there is 3.3% chance to get ambushed, then another 6.7% chance for cursed PC's,
then another 12.5% chance for doomed PC's. This gives about 21% chance if the PC is both cursed and doomed. However, you still avoid ambush if Pe>1d100, or 
if Alertness>1d150, or if you have the Scout talent and 10%.<p>

Case 2 will happen if not case 1 and if Stealth+Survival+X > 1d1000, where X = 500 - Level*10 if invisible (yes, being high level is worse here), X = 0 otherwise.<p>

Otherwise case 3.<p>

<a name="1642"></a><h4>1.6.4.2 Chance to evade</h4>
Lvl 6+ Druids and Lvl 25+ Rangers evade automatically. Others must pass at least one of the following four checks:<p>
<ol>
<li>Evade chance for an encounter type as in the above table. This chance is tripled if you had a choice of ambush
<li>Evade2 chance for invisible PC's only
<li>Stealth > 1d(200 - Min(Evade,Evade2))
<li>you have the Scout talent and 33%
</ol><p>

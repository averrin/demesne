<h3>Mindcraft</h3>
The art of Mindcraft is a very strange discipline.  Many believe it to
be just another type of magic, but the truly enlightened know that it
is a very different way of using one's inner strength and willpower.<p>

Mindcrafters utilize their mental powers to generate astonishing
effects.  The arts of Mindcraft and magic do not work very well
together.  Only long meditation and inner peace will allow a person to
awaken the mental powers within, while magic seems to encourage active
and curious minds.<p>

The following sections will describe the mental powers available to
Mindcrafters.  The number in brackets mentions the level at which the
power will become available.<p>

Be warned!  The powers of Mindcraft come at a price. Artificial and
mindless beings are immune to mental powers and undead are a great
danger to all Mindcrafters.  Their corrupted and insane minds are able
to backlash the mental powers upon the Mindcrafter, harming or killing
him.  Additionally, walls are not able to block the powers of the mind
-- so be careful about what might be lurking behind the next wall
before wildly employing Mindcraft.  Many beings don't like others
trying to toast their brains.
Your mindcrafter also might want to avoid contact with corrupted
monsters.  Sages claim that corrupted minds will transfer some of the
corruption to the contacting mind.<p>

Mental powers are fed with power points and if the character does not
have enough power points to activate the power, he is at a loss.  Some
powers are continuous and cost power points each turn.<p>

The following special powers are available in the game (W is the
shortcut for willpower, L for the level of the Mindcrafter):<p>

<b>Teleport Control (1)</b> - The ability to control your destination when
teleporting.<p>

<b>Confusion Blast (1)</b> - A linear blast which disturbs the minds of your
opponents and confuses them.<p>

<b>Confusion Wave (3)</b> - Similar to Confusion Blast, but affects all
beings within a certain range.<p>

<b>Mind Blast (6)</b> - A mental attack trying to destroy the brain cells of
the victims.  Damage: [{(W + L) / 6} + 1]d5.<p>

<b>Mental Shield (9)</b> - A mental defense, which affects both defensive and
protection values of the character.  DV: + [(L + W) / 5], PV: + [(L +
W) / 8].  Continuous power.<p>

<b>Mind Wave (12)</b> - A mental attack similar to Mind Blast, with the
difference that it affects all beings within a certain range.<p>

and is able to damage beings physically.  Damage: [(W / 5) + L]d3<p>

<b>Eyes of the Mind (18)</b> - A hypersense which allows the character to
sense creatures and beings within a certain range.<p>

Blast. Damage: [{(W + L) / 8} + 1]d9.<p>

<b>Greater Telekinetic Blast (30)</b> - A powerful force ball causing a lot
of physical damage to beings.  It might even be powerful enough to
shatter stone.  Damage: [(W / 5) + L]d6<p>

<b>Regeneration (35)</b> - A defensive power which allows the Mindcrafter to
heal his wounds.  Continuous power.<p>

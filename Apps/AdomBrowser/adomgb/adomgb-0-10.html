<a name="0a"></a><h3>Corruption</h3>
<a name="0a1"></a><h4>0.10.1 What is corruption?</h4>
There is only short, rather cryptic introduction to corruptions in the <a href="adomman-L.html">ADOM Manual</a>.
Corruption is unavoidable in the Drakalor Chain for any PC who wants 
to make progress in the game. It is a background process that happens 
as a result of the chaos gate at the bottom of the Caverns of Chaos 
being open. Some locations remain free of corruption despite the gate 
being open, notably those near the surface of the Drakalor Chain. In 
order to get anything done, however, the PC must descend into corrupting 
areas. It is only a matter of time after that until the first corruption 
occurs. After ninety days of game time elapses, corruption rate doubles. 
After the gate is closed, background corruption ceases, which is nice if 
the PC wants to play tourist for a while. However, corruption can still 
be caused by artifacts that corrupt (section <a href="#0a24">0.10.2.4</a>) 
as well as corrupting hits from monsters (section <a href="#0a23">0.10.2.3</a>).<p>

Note that the possible corruptions occur in random order (not the order 
listed on this page) which is decided at the beginning of the game. 
However, if one or more corruptions are removed, the RNG is reseeded and 
the corruptions will reoccur in a new random order.<p>

The following is a complete list of corruptions along with some comments 
about their effects and workarounds:<p>

<a name="0a11"></a><ol type="A">
<li><b>You are surrounded by an unholy aura (Ch: -10, DV: +6).</b><p>
This causes monsters to become afraid of the PC at more or less random times.
In their frightened state, they will flee. A very nasty side effect is that 
shopkeepers become homicidally enraged at PCs that move anywhere near shops with this 
corruption, fearing that their customers will be frightened away. Note that 
invisible PCs do not suffer the effects of this corruption: monsters that 
cannot see invisible do not detect this corruption. This works for 
shopkeepers until the "*foo* stares at your position with great intensity" 
message is generated. After that, look out.<p>

<li><b>You rage (DV: -9, +6 melee damage)!</b><p>
Mediocre increase to damage in exchange for losing nine points of DV. Not 
a very good bargain, especially for low level characters, since this will 
make them easier to hit (and some monster hits cause further corruption).<p>

<li><b>Poison drips from your hands.</b><p>
Some players hate this corruption more than any other. PCs with this 
corruption poison any monsters they engage in melee (a nice effect), turn 
any potion they touch into poison (very bad) and curse any food they touch
(very bad). It can result in starvation quickly. The workaround is to wear 
thick gauntlets, which negate all of the above effects. Alchemistic gloves 
also can negate these effects when picking up potions or food items, but it 
is not guaranteed. However, alchemistic gloves *never* block the effects 
when drinking potions or eating food. Note that Poison Hands does not prevent 
the PC from 'U'sing herbs, 'A'pplying Alchemy or dipping into potions.<p>

<li><b>You have grown thorns (3d3 melee damage, Dx: -2, Ap: -3).</b><p>
The extra melee damage occurs only when fighting unarmed. Also bleeding effect is added. 
Useful for Monks and Beastfighters, Necromancers using Shadow Touch. Useless waste of 2 Dx 
points for all others.<p>

<li><b>Your close attunement to corrupted astral space allows teleportation.</b><p>
Very, very nice if the PC has teleport control. Very, very annoying if the 
PC doesn't have teleport control.<p>

<li><b>You have grown a bulging cranium (Le: +6, Wi: +4, Ap: -6, PV: -4, To: -3).</b><p>
Nice Learning and Willpower increases. PV goes down because the PC's 
inflated skull is thinner, making it easier to damage? Not good for 
looks or Toughness either.<p>

<li><b>You are a living mana battery.</b><p>
Another nominee for the most hated corruption. All wands the PC touches are 
drained of their charges. This does not destroy them; their final charge can 
still be wrenched from them, but extremely annoying nonetheless. There is 
no workaround. Some side benefits: 1) every time the PC drains a 
wand, power points are added to the PC's power score: blessed wands give +2, 
uncursed +1 and cursed 0 2) Spell costs are reduced to 80% of their normal 
cost - note that this is not cumulative with Darknight / Silvernight 
reductions, since costs cannot drop below 50% 3) Mana regeneration is 
increased.<p>

<li><b>You have grown horns (+3 melee damage, Ap: -4).</b><p>
Melee damage in exchange for Appearance.<p>

<li><b>Your antennae explore the details of your environment (Ap: -4).</b><p>
Kicks in quasirandomly (1/250 chance every turn) to reveal a bit of the dungeon 
layout in the PC's immediate vicinity. Loss of Appearance.<p>

<li><b>Your skin is covered by tough scales (PV: +8, Dx: -6, Ap: -4).</b><p>
Nice PV increase, nasty Dexterity decrease. More loss of Appearance.<p>

<li><b>You have grown a total of 12 eyes (Ap: -6, Pe: +6).</b><p>
Nice Perception increase, still more loss of Appearance. Getting 
the idea? By the endgame, PCs tend to get *ugly*. ;-)<p>

<li><b>You exhale sulphur (Ch: -4).</b><p>
This enables the PC to spit a corrosive acid much the same as a 
Drakeling's racial ability.<p>

<li><b>You look somewhat apish (St: +3, Le: -1, Wi: -1, Ch: -2, Ap: -3).</b><p>
This corruption's effects reoccur periodically. 
Maximum is set at beggining of game, 1d10+4. Its effects are cumulative 
over time, so the PC keeps gaining Strength while losing Learning, Willpower, 
etc. The game notifies you when this is happening with the phrase "You 
suddenly remember your ancestors." Nice for fighter types, nasty for 
spellcasters.<p>

<li><b>Your corrupted tissue seems to heal much faster.</b><p>
Another corruption causing cumulative effects. The PC heals faster, but the 
process leaves scars which reduce both Dexterity and Appearance by one point 
for each scar. Nasty over time.<p>

<li><b>Your feet have been transformed into hooves (+8 kicking damage, Dx: -6).</b><p>
Nasty loss of Dexterity, especially since most PCs aren't kickers anyway.<p>

<li><b>You have become extremely thin and nimble (1/2 weight, DV: +6).</b><p>
Nice corruption. Six points of DV, but increases hunger by 1 per turn.
This is one of the corruptions needed to enter the Quickling Tree.<p>

<li><b>Your muscles have stiffened slowing you down (base action cost: 1500 energy
 points; PV: +4, St: +2).</b><p>
Another hated corruption. Slows down all your movement by 1.5X.<p>

<li><b>You have become very light (1/10 weight, St: -6, Dx: +4, To: -6, Ap: -6,
 +20 speed).</b><p>
Bad Strength and Toughness losses in exchange for speed and Dexterity.
And yes, more Appearance loss. This is the other corruption needed to 
enter the Quickling Tree.<p>
</ol><p>

Becoming corrupted beyond this point turns the PC into a chaos creature 
and the game ends at that point. All those purple 'j's are probably former 
adventurers.<p>

<a name="0a2"></a><h4>0.10.2 Gaining corruptions</h4>
The game keeps track of corruption with a numerical value which increments each
time twenty turns pass in a corrupting zone. Note that there are 18 corruptions
listed above. For each 1000 "points" of corruption, the PC gains one
corruption. Simple arithmetic shows that 180 points equals 1% corruption and
the PC gains a new corruption each time he passes a multiple of 1000/180 =
5.556%. This is a strict rule only up to 99% corruption. The 99% corruption
level begins at 99 * 180 = 17820 corruption points, but the PC is given extra
leeway at this point and does not transform into a chaos creature until the
counter is over 19000 points.<p>

<a name="0a21"></a><h4>0.10.2.1 Background corruption</h4>
As mentioned above, the PC must eventually enter areas where background 
corruption occurs. Areas with no corruption flag set:<p>
<ul>
<li>Small Cave before day 90
<li>Uninteresting Dungeon 
<li>Dusty Dungeon lvls 1-2 
<li>Village Dungeon 
<li>Druid Dungeon 
<li>Puppy Cave 
<li>Caverns of Chaos lvls 1-9 
<li>Infinite Dungeon lvls 1-9 
<li>Wilderness 
<li>Gremlin Cave 
<li>Dwarven Graveyard 
<li>Water Dragon Cave 
<li>Greater White Unicorn Glade 
<li>Terinyo 
<li>Lawenilothehl 
<li>High Mountain Village 
<li>Old Barbarian's Glade 
<li>Mad Minstrel's Clearing 
</ul><p>

Otherwise, the corruption points (CP's) gained depend on a Danger 
Level (DL) in particular area. Refer to section 
<a href="adomgb-0-13.html#0df">0.13.15</a> for the list of areas and their DL's.<p>

Thanks to Vladimir Panteleev for the following information.<p>

No other corruption occurs if:<P>
<ul>
<li>the current level has the NoCorruption flag set (see the list above)
<li>DL &lt; 10
<li>the chaos gate is closed
</ul><p>

The background corruption is applied once every N turns. If the PC is 
doomed, that's TWICE every N turns:<p>

 if (TurnNumber mod N=0) or (Doomed and (TurnNumber mod N=1)) then<p>

(this is how mathematicians/programmers say once normally and twice with 
doomed intrinsic per N turns)<p>

N is calculated based on the DL the PC is on.<p>
<ul>
<li>ID: N=CorruptionSpeed[ Max(Min(90,CurrentIDLevel)-10,0)/20 ]
<li>ID 66: N=20
<li>Levels with Danger Level>40: N=CorruptionSpeed[ (DangerLevel-5)/10 ] 
<li>Other N=CorruptionSpeed[ (DangerLevel-10)/10 ]
</ul><p>

CorruptionSpeed is a 5-element array<p>
<ul>
<li>CorruptionSpeed[0]=20
<li>CorruptionSpeed[1]=15
<li>CorruptionSpeed[2]=10
<li>CorruptionSpeed[3]= 5
<li>CorruptionSpeed[4]= 2
</ul><p>

Put in words, N can be 2, 5, 10, 15 or 20. The smaller N, the faster the
corruption. In the Infinite dungeon, N is 20 for levels 10-29, 15 for levels
30-49, 10 for levels 50-69, 5 for levels 70-89, and 2 for levels 90 and above.
The exception is level I: 66 (the special level with MaLaKaI) where N is 20.
For other areas, N is 20 for DL 10-19, 15 for DL 20-29, 10 for DL 30-39, 5 for
DL 40-44, and 2 for DL 45 and above.<p> 

If the background corruption is to be applied on this turn:<p>
<ul>
<li>1 CP is always applied
<li>if the current level is in the CoC and DL > 45, +2 CP
<li>chaos plane: +1d100 CP's
<li>emperor moloch's level: +1d33 CP's
</ul><p>

Now, there's a bug in the corrupting code. This is how it SHOULD have 
worked.<p>
<ul>
<li>+1 CP if it's beyond day 90.
<li>+2 CP if it's beyond day 180. (cumulative with previous)
<li>+3 CP if it's beyond day 270. (cumulative with previous)
<li>+4 CP if it's beyond day 360. (cumulative with previous)
</ul><p>

However, only the first line is executed - the 90-day limit.<P>

Being L+ decreases corruption by -30%, L or LN -10 %, C- enhances
corruption by +30%, lawful Unicorn-borns -10%, L50 Farmers and
lawful Paladins -30%, lvl50 Monks and Druids -10%.<p>

Note that since background corruption is applied only by 1-2 points, the 
above do not affect its speed, but major corruptions, such as eating 
chaotic corpses etc. The "crowned as champion" status does not affect 
corruption speed. By the way, 1 corruption = 1000 CP's.<p>

Note that a corrupting level can be made less so, or even completely 
noncorrupting, by reading scrolls of peace. These reduce the danger 
level, and thus the corruption rate of the current level. Bless the 
scrolls before reading them. The number of scrolls required depends on 
the level. If Dwarftown is generated on D: 10 or D: 11, for instance, 
reading two blessed scrolls of peace will probably stop corruption. On 
the other hand, if it is necessary to stop corruption on a particular 
level of the blue dragon caves, approximately nine scrolls of peace are 
required.<p>

<a name="0a22"></a><h4>0.10.2.2 Corruption traps</h4>
Corruption traps are as common as any other trap in the dungeons.
They cause 10d10 CP's. They are purple when revealed.<p>

<a name="0a23"></a><h4>0.10.2.3 Corrupting hits from monsters</h4>
Some monsters corrupt by hitting the PC in melee. Common ones
include chaos brothers, chaos sisters and the grues found in
the elemental temples. <a href="adomgb-app-J.html">Appendix J</a> contains 
a complete list.<p>

<a name="0a24"></a><h4>0.10.2.4 Artifacts which corrupt</h4>
<a name="0a241"></a><h4>0.10.2.4.1 Moon Sickle</h4>
Moon Sickle is a unique artifact unlike any other in the game. It does not
contain the essence of Chaos and Corruption and so does not corrupt merely by
carrying it. Likewise, wielding it does not cause corruption. However,
successfully hitting a monster with Moon Sickle adds 2d3 CP's. Although it has
no slaying powers, it is worth considering as a weapon against very difficult
monsters for those PCs who have trained polearms, despite its corrupting
nature. It has excellent base damage at 10d4+6 and polearms have decent to-hit
and to-damage modifiers. Remember, however, that Moon Sickle is autocursing.<p>

<a name="0a242"></a><h4>0.10.2.4.2 When carried</h4>
The following artifacts contain the essence of Chaos and
Corruption and will corrupt the PC merely by carrying them:<p>
<ul>
<li>The Black Tome of Alsophocus
<li>The Amulet of Raw Steel
<li>The Shield of Raw Steel
<li>The Spear of Raw Steel
<li>The Boots of Great Speed
<li>The Sceptre of Chaos
<li>The Medal of Chaos
<li>The Crown of Chaos
</ul><p>

The The Black Tome of Alsophocus teaches the PC random spell, or improves 
knowledge in a known spell if read successfully. It grants 20 CP's per
turn spent reading (base PP cost of the spell + 3), but min 200 and max 6666. 
The corrupting artifacts provide about 1/2 CP per turn when in backpack, 
and almost 1 CP per turn when equipped. The effects are cumulative. Of course 
more corruption is applied when successfully used (spear &amp; sceptre).<p>

<a name="0a243"></a><h4>0.10.2.4.3 When used</h4>
All of the Chaos Orbs fall into this category, however, there is a great deal
of difference in the amount of corruption caused by using the different Chaos
Orbs. Stephen White has determined the precise amount of corruption caused:<p>

<table border=1>
<caption>Corruption caused by using the Chaos Orbs</caption>
<tr>
<th>Chaos Orb <th>CP's added per use<th>Effect
<tr><td>Water <td>600 <td>full HP
<tr><td>Fire <td>300 <td>fireball
<tr><td>Air <td>500 <td>air elemental pet
<tr><td>Earth <td>300 <td>earthquake
<tr><td>Mana <td>5000<td>full PP; +3 Ma
</table><p>

Note that if a PC is wearing the elemental gauntlets when the orbs are used,
the above corruption points are halved.<p>

<a name="0a25"></a><h4>0.10.2.5 Potions of raw chaos</h4>
Logically enough, if the PC drinks a potion of raw chaos it will cause
corruption (50d5/50d10/50d30 CP's B/U/C). They can also corrupt, however, 
if the PC tries to use them to polymorph an item by dipping it in the potion. 
There is a chance the potion will explode, which causes 100d100 CP's as 
well as 10d30 damage.
Dipping in potions of raw chaos will not make wands of wishing or rings of
djinni summoning. See section <a href="adomgb-0-14.html#0e4">0.14.4</a>.<p>

<a name="0a26"></a><h4>0.10.2.6 Tracts of chaos</h4>
Tracts of chaos grant corruption, ~100 CP's per reading.
See section <a href="adomgb-0-2.html#027">0.2.7</a>.<p>

<a name="0a27"></a><h4>0.10.2.7 From pools</h4>
Drinking from pools may result in the message "You feel corrupted!" (1/52 
chance). Self-explanatory, DLd30 CP's. Additionaly, a pool inside Stone Circle 
causes massive corruption (10d100 CP's) per sip.<p>

<a name="0a28"></a><h4>0.10.2.8 From corpses</h4>
Some corpses will corrupt the PC if eaten. Obvious ones include the
corpses of the Chaos Orb guardians. Others include Keethrax, Keriax
and chaos animals. The effects won't be compiled here. You can browse
<a href="adomgb-app-J.html">Appendix J</a> or section 
<a href="adomgb-0-3.html#033">0.3.3</a> for corruptions resulting from 
eating monster corpses.<p>

<a name="0a29"></a><h4>0.10.2.9 Riurry - the Greater Black Unicorn quest</h4>
Riurry will reward the PC with 1 - 2 corruptions for killing the Greater
White Unicorn Yrruir.<p>

<a name="0a2a"></a><h4>0.10.2.10 Being crowned a champion of chaos</h4>
Being crowned a champion of chaos will cause 2 - 3 immediate corruptions
in addition to making further corruption faster. Additionaly, 75% of demons 
will be generated neutral to crowned chaotics.<p>

<a name="0a3"></a><h4>0.10.3 Removing corruptions</h4>
There will be a time when your PC wants to remove one or more corruptions. Some
corruptions are very troublesome and worth getting rid of immediately. Later in 
the game, removing corruptions may be necessary simply to extend the life of the 
PC. Whatever the reason, a thorough knowledge of how to remove corruptions 
should be part of every experienced player's repertoire. There are several ways 
of doing this as outlined below. Corruption removal items are among the most 
precious in the game. They should always be blessed unless the PC is trying to 
specifically remove only one corruption that is impossible to deal with (poison 
hands can be impossible to deal with without thick gauntlets) while preserving 
others (for instance one needed to enter the Quickling Tree).<p>

<a name="0a31"></a><h4>0.10.3.1 Potions of cure corruption</h4>
Potions of cure corruption are exactly what the name implies - they remove 
corruption, approximately 0.75 corruptions for each blessed potion of cure 
corruption the PC drinks. A potion of cure corruption is also a quest object for 
Gaab'Baay.<p>

Beware of cursed potions of cure corruption. They cause corruption rather 
than curing it.<p>

Magnus Malm has done some research on potions of cure corruption:<p>

<table border=1>
<caption>Potions of cure corruption</caption>
<tr>
<th>Status</th> <th colspan="10">Ten trials: corruption points added or removed</th> <th>Min</th> <th>Ave</th> <th>Max</th><th>Dice</th>
<tr><td>Cursed <td>+147 <td>+139 <td>+151 <td>+147 <td>+168 <td>+138 <td>+147 <td>+122 <td>+150 <td>+162 <td>+138 <td>+147 <td>+168<td>-50d5
<tr><td>Uncursed <td>-298 <td>-298 <td>-283 <td>-258 <td>-296 <td>-291 <td>-279 <td>-275 <td>-304 <td>-279 <td>-258 <td>-286 <td>-304<td>50d10
<tr><td>Blessed <td>-695 <td>-733 <td>-735 <td>-795 <td>-734 <td>-812 <td>-826 <td>-841 <td>-804 <td>-716 <td>-695 <td>-769 <td>-841<td>50d30
</table><p>

<a name="0a311"></a><h4>0.10.3.1.1 Obtaining potions of cure corruption from Guth'Alak</h4>
Potions of cure corruption can be obtained from the druid Guth'Alak in Terinyo.
He will reward a non-chaotic PC with a potion of cure corruption for delivering 
a greater chaos creature's or highly corrupted creature's corpse to him.<p>

He will provide potion of corruption for the corpse of the following monsters:<p>
<ul>
<li>Snake From Beyond 
<li>Master Summoner 
<li>Ancient Stone Beast 
<li>Ancient Chaos Wyrm 
<li>Greater Black Unicorn 
<li>Chaos Archmage 
<li>Black Unicorn 
<li>Black Druid 
<li>Emperor Moloch 
<li>Multi-Headed Chaos Dragon
</ul><p>

If the PC is chaotic, it is a good idea to sell a chaos creature's corpse to 
Munxip for safekeeping, then buy it back at a later time when the PC is non-
chaotic. It can then be traded to Guth'Alak for a potion of cure corruption.<p>

<a name="0a32"></a><h4>0.10.3.2 Scrolls of chaos resistance</h4>
Blessed scrolls of chaos resistance remove about 1.5 corruptions per reading.
There are several places where scrolls of chaos resistance can be obtained: the
only absolutely guaranteed location is the hidden room in the High Mountain
Village. This will always contain one scroll of chaos resistance, although
beware - it is always cursed. Khelavaster will give six scrolls of chaos
resistance to a PC that manages to save him. The dwarven mystic in Dwarftown
may give four blessed scrolls of chaos resistance to neutral PCs. The bug temple
has three cursed scrolls of chaos resistance. Finally, the Mad Minstrel will reward
a PC who brings him the Weird Tome with five cursed scrolls of chaos resistance.<p> 

Beware of cursed scrolls of chaos resistance. They cause corruption rather
than curing it.<p>

Magnus Malm has done some research on scrolls of chaos resistance:<p>

<table border=1><caption>Scrolls of chaos resistance</caption>
<tr><th>Status</th> <th colspan="10">Ten trials: corruption points added or removed</th> <th>Min</th> <th>Ave</th> <th>Max</th><th>Dice</th>
<tr><td>Cursed <td>+293 <td>+286 <td>+301 <td>+304 <td>+324 <td>+304 <td>+311 <td>+307 <td>+284 <td>+299 <td>+284 <td>+301 <td>+324<td>-100d5
<tr><td>Uncursed <td>-595 <td>-567 <td>-539 <td>-565 <td>-618 <td>-514 <td>-562 <td>-552 <td>-500 <td>-533 <td>-500 <td>-555 <td>-618<td>100d10
<tr><td>Blessed <td>-1649 <td>-1512 <td>-1458 <td>-1561 <td>-1415 <td>-1542 <td>-1561 <td>-1279 <td>-1507 <td>-1652 <td>-1415 <td>-1544 <td>-1652<td>100d30
</table><p>

Note that these numbers are to a first approximation double those of potions of
cure corruption. Thus cursed SoCRs are twice as bad as cursed PoCCs, while
blessed SoCRs are twice as good as blessed PoCCs. The implications should be
obvious: never drink or read any cursed corruption removal item, and bless
SoCRs in any but a dire emergency.<p>

<a name="0a33"></a><h4>0.10.3.3 Tracts of order</h4>
Reading a tract of order amounts to an appeal to the lawful god for corruption
removal. This is not free and uses up piety. Do not try this with a PC who does
not have a very good relationship with his lawful god. (not exactly true - see section <a href="adomgb-0-2.html#027">0.2.7</a>) 
The amount of corruption removed is around 100 CP's. Tracts of order
are most useful to get rid of an annoying corruption as soon as it occurs, thus
reseeding the RNG and hopefully avoiding it the next time a PC receives a
corruption.<p>

<a name="0a34"></a><h4>0.10.3.4 Yrruir - the Greater White Unicorn quest</h4>
Yrruir will remove all corruption <b>once</b> as a reward for the PC killing the 
Greater Black Unicorn - Riurry. It is wise to wait to use this cleansing until 
it is absolutely necessary. If the PC is doing a normal ending, this should 
ideally be the last thing the PC does before leaving the Drakalor Chain to 
ensure a corruption-free ending, which leads to better scores and a happier
future history for the PC after the game is finished.<p>

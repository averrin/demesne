<a name="G1"></a><h3>Weapon Skills</h3>
Every character also has some weapon skills he can train.  Weapon
skills can only be increased in one way: by practice.  Basically, this
means that your skill will increase after a certain number of
successful attacks (hits).  Depending on the weapon type, this can
result in increases in to-hit and to-damage ratings.  Hand weapons
also can yield a bonus to the character's DV.<p>

Note that ADOM traditionally assumes that everyone is right-handed
and thus your right hand will be your stronger hand. This might (in
certain cases) result in reduced bonusses if your character for
whatever reason prefers to wield weapon in his off-hand.<p>

For all weapons the following titles of mastery are used.<p>

<table border=1><caption>Weapon Skills Titles</caption>
<tr><th>Weapon Level    <th>Level

For melee weapons, the following numbers are used to mirror the
experience of a character with the weapon of his choice (note how
different weapon types yield different advantages):<p>

</table><p>

If a character wields two melee weapons, his DV modifier is calculated
by taking the DV modifier of the weapon in the right hand plus
one-half of the DV modifier of the left hand weapon.  If the character
fights without any weapon he will receive DV bonuses but once.
Wielding a shield does not count as fighting unarmed since it impedes
your mobility.<p>

Missile weapon skills yield a +2 to hit and +1 to damage for every
skill level and an additional +1 to damage for skill levels 2, 4, 6,
8, 10, 12 and 14.  Missile weapon skills have no effect on the
character's DV, but instead, the range of your missiles is increased by
+1 for every 3 skill levels.<p>

The shield skill yields a +2 bonus to DV per level in that skill.  The
trick is that you can't get a higher bonus to your DV than twice your
shield DV bonus (e.g. if your shield yields a +4 DV bonus, the shield
skill can't provide more than +8 to DV).  Shield skill marks are
gained when you manage to block an attack with your shield (e.g. the
attack would have hit without your shield DV bonus).  A prerequisite
for gaining more shield skill marks is to use a shield that would
allow you to benefit from a higher shield skill.  You also must not
fight with berserk tactics (see the 'T' command).  When you are using
two shields, you will only gain the better skill bonus of the two, not
both, since two shields are too unwieldy to be used effectively.<p>

The following table shows the number of required successful weapon
checks to advance to the level in question (after achieving a new
level you start collecting marks from scratch).  Note that missile
weapons require but one-half as many marks.<p>

<table border=1><caption>Weapon Skills Marks</caption>
<tr><td>Level <td> 1<td> 2 <td> 3 <td> 4 <td> 5  <td> 6  <td> 7 <td>  8 <td>  9 <td>  10  <td> 11 <td>  12  <td> 13  <td> 14  <td> 15
<tr><td>Melee <td>15 <td>25<td>40 <td>65 <td>105<td> 170 <td>275 <td>445 <td>720 <td>1165 <td>1885 <td>3050<td> 4935 <td>7985 <td>12920
<tr><td>Missl  <td>7 <td>12<td> 20 <td>32 <td> 52 <td> 85<td> 137<td> 222 <td>360 <td> 582 <td> 942 <td>1525 <td>2467 <td>3992 <td> 6460
</table><p>

NOTE: If your character is fighting too defensively, he won't get any
marks for successful attacks (which basically means that you should
not use the 'very defensive' and 'coward' settings of the 'T'
command, if you want to increase your weapon skills).<p>

NOTE: The number of marks required to increase a weapon skill is
partially dependent on the class of your character.  True spellcasters
(wizards, necromancers and elementalists) need twice as many marks as
listed above.  Semi-spellcasters (priests and druids) actually need
50% more marks than listed above.  Farmers are so skilled in the use
of polearms that they need 20% less marks to increase in their use.
All other classes need to collect the number of marks specified above.<p>

NOTE: A character can hone his melee skills only to a certain amount
when fighting against the same monster.  After a certain time (a
certain number of turns), he will have picked up all the specific
tricks and moves of the monster and will no longer gain any weapon
skills by fighting that specific beast.  The more powerful a monster
is, the more you usually will be able to learn from it.<p>

NOTE: Fighting with two whips at once is not recommended since this is
*very* difficult since you have to avoid getting entangled in your
weapons.  Rules-wise this means that you will require a lot of speed
to fight effectively with these two whips.<p>

<a name="G2"></a><h3>Weapon Skills and Attack Energy</h3>
Attacking with a weapon without the appropriate skill requires 1000
energy points.  If you attack with a weapon you are skilled with, the
attack energy required is reduced according to the following table:<p>

<table border=1><caption>Weapon Skills Energy</caption>
<tr><td>Skill   <td> 0  <td> 1 <td>  2  <td> 3 <td>  4 <td>  5  <td> 6  <td> 7  <td> 8  <td> 9  <td>10 <td> 11 <td> 12 <td> 13  <td>14 <td> 15
<tr><td>Cost <td> 1000 <td>980 <td>960 <td>940<td> 920<td> 895 <td>870 <td>845<td> 820 <td>790<td> 760 <td>730 <td>700 <td>665<td> 630<td> 595
</table><p>

        Fighting with two weapons costs [800 plus the maximum of the
two attack energy values for the weapons in question] energy points
(although possession of the Two Weapon Combat skill can lower this).<p>

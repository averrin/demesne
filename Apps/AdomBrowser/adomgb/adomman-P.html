<a name="P1"></a><h3>Dice</h3>
Roleplaying games mostly use dice to determine random events.  Paper
games rely on several kinds of dice -- most often 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, 12-
and 20-sided dice are used.  Computers are not limited by arbitrary
die forms and thus enjoy the freedom to use any kind of dice
imaginable as a random number generator.<p>

Roleplayers use an abbreviated way of describing the number of dice to
be rolled to generate a random number.  Basically a certain number of
dice is rolled, all the face values are added and maybe a modifier is
added or subtracted to generate a total.  This is normally abbreviated
as<p>
<pre>
                        {x}d{y}+{z}
</pre>
and means to roll {x} dice with {y} faces and finally to add the value
{z}.  {z} can be positive or negative.  If {z} is not mentioned, it is
assumed to be zero.<p>

EXAMPLES: 1d20 means to roll one 20-sided die to generate a number
between 1 and 20.  2d6 means to roll two 6-sided dice to generate a
number between 2 and 12.  4d4+3 means to roll four 4-sided dice and
finally add 3 to generate a number between 7 and 19.  3d13-9 means to
roll three 13-sided dice and subtract 9 to generate a number between
-6 and 30.<p>

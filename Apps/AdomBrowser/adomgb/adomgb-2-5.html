<h3>Dwarftown</h3>
<A HREF="adomgb-2-5-pic.html" target="blank">Click here</A> for a color map of Dwarftown.<p>
Dwarftown is an important milestone in the game. It is a source of numerous
helpful NPCs and locations, including a shop, a smithy, a coaligned altar (for 
non-chaotics) and a training hall where stats may be increased. Of equal
importance is the fact that it is a resting place. After the descent through
the upper CoC, the PC can rest here without constantly being assaulted by monsters.  
There is nothing hostile in Dwarftown initially, with the exception of an 
almost-guaranteed mimic in Waldenbrook's shop (note the empty space in the shop 
in the map below - it is a mimic).<p>

<a name="251"></a><h4>2.5.1 Waldenbrook</h4>
Waldenbrook is the shopkeeper in Dwarftown. His is a general store type of shop selling
and buying a variety of goods. He occasionally stocks an item or two of high quality, 
sometimes even an artifact. His prices are generally reasonable. Bear in mind, however,
that he has the same racial prejudices as all other shopkeepers
 (see section <a href="adomgb-0-13.html#0d73">0.13.7.3</a>).<p>

<a name="252"></a><h4>2.5.2 Ruun</h4>
Ruun, the Priest in Dwarftown is always generated with the same race as the PC. He
presides over a small room containing an altar, which will be coaligned unless the PC is 
chaotic. If a coaligned PC is carrying unidentified potions, it is worth 'C'hatting with
him. He will identify potions that have a healing effect: potions of (extra/ultra)
healing and potions of cure poison. If a PC whose alignment does not match the altar's
'C'hats with him he responds with "Ye oughta convert. Then we'll talk."<p>

Donating gold to Ruun moves the PC's alignment closer to that of the altar.<p>

Note that converting the altar in Dwarftown (perhaps even attempting to convert it) will 
cause Ruun to become hostile, which in turn causes the entire town to become hostile.  
Luring him out of Dwarftown, killing him and then returning will not work either, as his 
shade returns to inform the dwarves of what has happened, resulting in the same scenario.  
Unless your PC knows exactly what he is doing and why he is doing it, angering or attacking 
Ruun is highly inadvisable. See also section <a href="#258">2.5.8</a> below about the Demented Ratling
and causing commotion in Dwarftown.<p>

The stubborn singlemindedness of the Dwarves regarding Ruun has an interesting side effect.
If a pet, slave or the greater daemon, for instance, kills Ruun the entire town including
Thrundarr (but not Waldenbrook) will pursue that creature. This is another way to get Thrundarr
off his lever.<p>

<a name="253"></a><h4>2.5.3 Thrundarr</h4>
Thrundarr is the village elder. He can provide background information on a variety of subjects 
(Dwarftown, City, Chaos, Corruption, Khelavaster, Terinyo, Waldenbrook, Glod, Garth, Grizzled Gladiator, 
Torgall, Orc, Si, Flame, Fire, Axe, Gold, Phial, Caladriel, Eternal Guardian, King, Banshee, 
Griff, Rolf, Groron, Gorko),
none of which is really crucial to completing the game. He assigns six lawful quests regardless 
of alignment. They are listed in the next section.<p>

Two Dwarven Elite Guardians stand guard outside Thrundarrs' house. They are extremely strong, 
and are not to be taken lightly. They also defy entrance towards dwarven elder for blind or 
mute characters.<p>

<a name="2531"></a><h4>2.5.3.1 Thrundarr's quests, their rewards and the significance of the rewards</h4>
Several quests are available from Thrundarr once the PC achieves experience level six.  
Talking to Thrundarr about 'quest' provides access to them:<p>

The first five quests are available in this order:<p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Slay a random creature. This can be a very annoying quest. Thrundarr can assign anything
   ranging from a goblin to a Ghost Lord. The random creature is randomly created for dangerlevel 
   MAX(PLAYERLEVEL,DWARFTOWN_DANGER_RATING) + 3. Only creatures with relative probability 25
   or higher will be chosen. The random creature is a not too rare creature that could be found by
   the player during normal playing. No dwarves, lawful creatures or vortices
   will be assigned. Also, quest monsters are generated with extra HP based on PC's level. 
   The reward is having the PC's entire inventory identified or the (artifact) potion of literacy 
   for illiterate characters.<p>

<li>Find out what is beyond the Animated Forest. The PC has two choices here: traverse the Animated
   Forest or bypass it and descend through the Dwarven Halls. See section <a href="#2532">2.5.3.2</a> below about
   these locations. The reward for this quest is a blessed wand of fireballs with twelve charges.
   This comes in very handy in the Pyramid (see section <a href="adomgb-2-9.html">2.9</a>).
   WARNING:<br>
   Be very careful when wandering around below Dwarftown before receiving this quest. Entering
   the Animated Forest for even a single turn before the quest is assigned results in Thrundarr 
   refusing to assign it, instead assigning another random monster quest with *no reward*. Since 
   the wand of fireballs (blessed with twelve charges, no less) can be very useful, entering the 
   Animated Forest before the quest is assigned is very unwise. Note that this does not occur
   if the PC enters the Dwarven Halls.<p>

<li>Kill the ogre tribe below Dwarftown - the staircase to this level is generated between the 
   Dwarven Mystic's room and the Green Griffon Inn. See section <a href="#2533">2.5.3.3</a> below about this quest.
   The reward is 5000 gold pieces, useful for training with Garth (see section <a href="#255">2.5.5</a>).<p>

<li>Become the Champion of the Arena - if the PC is already the Champion of the Arena, another 
   random monster quest is assigned - a very good reason *not* to become the Champion until this 
   quest is assigned. Instead of a cash reward, the PC is given an artifact sword, the Golden
   Gladius, for winning the 20th Arena fight. Thrundarr's rewards for this quest are usually
   pieces of equipment which vary according to the class of the PC and possibly the RNG.  
   A couple of examples:<p>
       A Mindcrafter (probably) received:
<pre>
       blessed mithril cap [+0, +2]                         [40s]
       blessed adamantium chain mail (-1, -3) [-1, +8]     [288s]
       blessed mithril girdle [+0, +2]                      [20s]
       blessed adamantium long sword (+0, 1d8+5)            [28s]
       blessed medium mithril shield [+5, +1]               [80s]
       blessed ring of fire resistance                       [1s]
       blessed adamantium boots [+0, +3]                    [89s]
</pre>
       A Wizard and a Beastfighter both received:<p>
<pre>
       heap of 8 blessed bandages                           [16s]
       blessed waterproof blanket                           [10s]
       blessed fireproof blanket                            [10s]
       blessed ring of fire resistance                       [1s]
       heap of 5 uncursed potions of extra healing          [10s]
       uncursed potion of gain attributes                    [4s]
       uncursed potion of ultra healing                      [2s]
       blessed scroll of familiar summoning                  [2s]
</pre>
   The bandages, blankets, etc. seem to be the most common set of equipment received as a reward 
   for this quest.<p>

   These are nice enough, but of no great consequence in the context of the whole game. Of greater
   importance is the fact that the PC now has the Golden Gladius. It can be exchanged for training
   with Bart the grizzled gladiator. See section <a href="#2571">2.5.7.1</a> below.<p>

   It is also possible to receive the artifact dwarven shield "Rolf's 
   Saviour" as a reward for this quest. Lawful alignment is requirement along with
   cooperation from the RNG (1/6 chance, 4/9 for Dwarves).<p>
   
<li>Slay a greater daemon that has been terrorizing Dwarftown. The greater daemons HP is increased by 
(PLAYERLEVEL + DWARFTOWN_DANGER_RATING) * 2. If the player is above level 15, the daemons
level is then increased by (PLAYERLEVEL - 15). The daemon can be a difficult
   opponent, particularly if it becomes entangled with the dwarves in the city. Bear in mind the
   fact that the greater daemon can kill NPCs who may be helpful later. This includes the demented
   ratling, which destroys the possibility of any special ending. The greater daemon breathes fire
   and is a stat drainer. It can be sacrificed on the altar in Dwarftown. If the PC is lucky enough
   to have found demon slaying ammo, use it! There will be more found later. The reward for this
   quest is the artifact mace Big Punch, which many PCs find useless because it is so heavy - 800 
   stones. It is potential sacrificial fodder.
</ol><p>

Thrundarr's sixth quest, available at any time and often taken out of order by many players, is to 
free the spirit of Griff Bloodax, a dwarven hero who has been turned into an undead dwarven chaos 
berserker by the master necromancer Nonnak. It is necessary to ask him about 'portal' to obtain this 
quest. In return for completing this quest, Thrundarr provides some equipment rewards (see section
<a href="adomgb-2-7.html">2.7</a>)
 and more importantly opens the dwarven portal leading to the deeper CoC. Note that it is not
strictly necessary to do this quest. Thrundarr stands on a lever that controls the portal. If he 
is removed from that location, the PC can 'h'andle the lever himself. Methods for accomplishing this
include teleporting Thrundarr, confusing him and killing him.<p>

Thrundarr is teleportation resistant, thus using charges from a wand of teleportation is not 
recommended unless there is no alternative. A PC with the Teleportation spell has no problem.
Teleporting him causes no alignment drop; Thrundarr does not become hostile and he will still assign 
quests. Killing him is a rather drastic act with all sorts of negative consequences. He is not a terribly 
powerful opponent, but has immense PV. Penetrating weapons or spells are necessary to kill him. His stats are DV 10, PV 100, 
Hits 3, Attacks 1, Damage 12-30, Speed 100. Using
Ventriloquism on him is fairly easy, confuses him and causes him to wander off the lever. It causes
an alignment drop roughly equivalent to killing him but does not curse or doom the PC nor are muscular 
dwarves summoned. It does make Thrundarr hostile after he recovers from his confusion. This causes
an amusing scenario as the non-hostile dwarves encounter a hostile Thrundarr wandering around 
Dwarftown chasing the PC.<p>

Drakeling spit will also cause him to move from the lever without negative consequences. This is presumably a bug.<p>

The PC should actually do the quest unless there is a very specific reason not to do so, since there 
are very useful artifacts generated during the quest. See section <a href="adomgb-2-7.html">2.7</a>
for more about this quest.<p>

<a name="2532"></a><h4>2.5.3.2 The Animated Forest and the Dwarven Halls</h4>
Thrundarr asks the PC to pass through the Animated Forest and find out 
what lies beyond. He also mentions a possibly dangerous shortcut which
turn out to be the Dwarven Halls DH: 1 and DH: 2. On approximately
D: 13 there will be a level that has two down staircases. One leads to
the Animated Forest, the other to the Dwarven Halls. It is impossible
to tell them apart. <p>

Passing through the Animated Forest is a test of one's patience among 
other things. The entire level is filled with living trees milling
about. The majority are not hostile but will of course become hostile
if attacked. It is difficult to get through them without accidentally
hitting one or more. When the PC encounters hostile trees it is best
not to try to fight them but rather keep moving. In fact it is usually
best to be as defensive as possible and forget about offense completely: 
wield two shields and use Coward tactics. The hostile trees will
usually be left behind in the crowd. It seems to be best to keep moving
in any case and refrain from resting on one square. Invisibility is a
tremendous asset in the Animated Forest, but PCs usually do not have it 
available at this stage of the game.  Note that fireballs, from the wand 
or spell, as well as the Burning Hands spell, should not be used in the 
Animated Forest. While they are effective, the whole forest becomes
hostile. This generates too many hostile trees for a PC at this level 
to cope with. Interestingly, fire bolts, from the spell or wand, are 
also effective, but do not cause the forest to become hostile.
The trees do not see in Darkness, so that tactic can also be used.<p>

The alternative to the tedium of the Animated Forest is a descent through 
the Dwarven Halls. This is much faster but potentially dangerous. Very
out-of-depth monsters can be generated in the Dwarven Halls. 
Use Scroll or Wand of Monster detection, if possible, upon entering each level 
of the Dwarven Halls. This will allow you to immediately identify any dangerous 
creatures, and make a judgment about whether or not the level is remotely safe 
to explore. Furthermore, this will allow you to identify and avoid tension rooms.
If the PC
has invisibility, seven league boots or anything that increases speed, 
wear them before entering in case it becomes necessary to flee.  
Exploring other than finding the down stairways is highly inadvisable.<p>

Both of these locations can be problematic. The Animated Forest is 
always incredibly tedious. The Dwarven Halls can be a cakewalk if the
PC is lucky enough to have the stairways generated close together.  
They can also be a virtual instadeath if a very nasty monster shows up.
As Thrundarr says, "It's yer choice."<p>

<a name="2533"></a><h4>2.5.3.3 The Ogre Cave</h4>
There is an ogre tribe containing 37 ogres, 2 ogre maguses, 1 ogre lord 
below Dwarftown which Thrundarr asks the PC 
to eliminate. This quest is relatively easy compared to getting
through the Animated Forest or Dwarven Halls. The ordinary ogres have
no special attacks and the PC should be able to bash them with brute 
force combined with missile attacks or blast them with magic. Weaker
races might find a corpse or two that grants a Strength increase. A 
potential problem is the ogre magi present on the level. They are
capable of becoming invisible and casting Frost Bolt. PCs who have
no cold resistance need to watch out for them. Wear an amulet of the 
cold heart if the PC has one. There are also a couple of ogre lords 
present, which are tougher than the ordinary ogres. Once again, none of
the ogres can see in Darkness. There is a bug in the game which prevents
pets from inflicting any damage on the level. Do not rely on them.<p>

<a name="254"></a><h4>2.5.4 The Dwarven Mystic</h4>
The Dwarven Mystic is found in a 2 x 2 sealed room east of the room
containing the altar. The most common way to get in is by teleporting.
The Dwarven Mystic is a guaranteed source of the artifact 
dwarven rune axe Rolf's Companion for lawfuls. Neutrals never 
receive the axe, but rather 7 blessed potions of insight and 4 
blessed potions of chaos resistance, OR 2 potions of training and
1 potion of gain attributes (50% chance for each case). Several gammas ago, 
Rolf's Companion was a very powerful artifact. Recently, it has been
weakened to the point that many players regard the possibility of 
getting four scrolls of chaos resistance from the Dwarven Mystic as an 
argument for neutral alignment at this point in the game. Chaotics 
will receive nothing from him. He responds with the message "It
wasn't you I've been waiting for!"<p>

Note that teleportation traps may be conveniently generated adjacent to 
and within the dwarven mystic's room. However, this is only possible if
Dwarftown is generated on D: 11.:<p>
<pre>
  .....^
  .####.
  .#.^#.
  .#^.#.
  .####.
  ^.....
</pre>
The carets represent locations where a teleportation trap may be created.<p>

It is also possible to open the walls of the Dwarven Mystic's room 
with a wand of destruction. This is somewhat dangerous, since nearby 
townspeople, and perhaps the Dwarven Mystic himself, may be damaged by 
the blast, causing some, or all, inhabitants of Dwarftown to become 
hostile. If the player is careful, it is possible to destroy the 
walls, 'C'hat with the Dwarven Mystic and receive his rewards in the 
usual manner.<p>

If a PC with non-chaotic alignment has committed a crime in Dwarftown 
which results in an alarm gong being rung and muscular dwarves being 
summoned, the Dwarven Mystic responds with a different message "Ye art 
doomed!" This does not result in the PC gaining the cursed or doomed
intrinsics. A wished-for Dwarven Mystic also always responds with
this message.<p>

<a name="255"></a><h4>2.5.5 Garth and Training</h4>
Garth is the dwarven weaponmaster found in the training hall east of 
Thrundarr's room. Garth will train all stats except Appearance and
Mana. The formula for how much to pay is $100 * stat value, doubled
once for each 5 points over 15. Here are examples of what to pay Garth:<p>

<table border=1>
<tr><th>Stat<th>Payment   <th>Multiplier
<tr><td>   1-15 <td>         100 -   1500gp <td>100x
<tr><td>  16-20 <td>        3200 -   4000gp <td>200x
<tr><td>  21-25 <td>        8400 -  10000gp <td>400x
<tr><td>  26-30 <td>       20800 -  24000gp <td>800x
<tr><td>  31-35 <td>       49600 -  56000gp <td>1600x
<tr><td>  36-40 <td>      115200 - 128000gp <td>3200x
<tr><td>  41-45 <td>      262400 - 288000gp <td>6400x
<tr><td>  46-50 <td>      588800 - 640000gp <td>12800x
</table><p>

Note that the effects of training do not happen instantaneously. The
stat has simply been trained. The game checks every so often (and
always when gaining an experience level) to see if a stat is eligible 
for an increase. This is when the stat will rise. Note also that it
is possible to pay Garth once and receive several stat increases as a 
result. This is particularly useful for those PC's with a very low stat
score in one or more categories. Paying Garth well in excess of the
amount needed to raise the stat will result in multiple stat increases 
over time.<p>

Note that there is a manual entry under the Attributes section that 
states the following:<p>

"The potential maximum attribute scores are based on the initial
attribute scores. The maximum for an attribute is dependent on the
base score and the player race. These maximums can only rarely be
surpassed by natural training. This is a long and arduous process.
Only magical methods can exceed these limits with ease."<p>

This seems to imply that Garth cannot train a stat beyond its natural 
maximum. This may be true under "reasonable" circumstances. Giving
Garth massive amounts of gold may be a different story.<p>

The method described above is somewhat obsolete. Here are lists of how 
much you should pay to guarantee an increase in a stat - you can  
pay less money for less than a 100% chance.<p>

<a name="256"></a><h4>2.5.6 Glod and Smithing</h4>
Glod, the dwarven smith in Dwarftown, will teach the Smithing skill.  
There is a price for this which depends on gender, Charisma, cursed
status, doomed status, and race (see <a href="adomgb-0-14.html#0ed">0.14.13</a>).
Smithing is taught at 1d10 + 20. It also trains Strength +100 and Toughness +200.<p>

Glod is also capable of removing rust from rusted items and fixing 
certain broken items, notably pickaxes, again, for a price of 
ItemValue * 150 if pickaxe, or ItemValue * 1500 otherwise. 
Removing rust costs ItemValue * 30. It has been 
reported that after removing rust from an item a number of times, Glod 
will offer to rustproof the item.<p>

After learning the Smithing skill, Glod will make his equipment 
available to the PC for a price, typically 2500 gold pieces.<p>

It is possible to teleport Glod away from his smithy, although the 
details (wand of teleportation vs the Teleportation spell) have yet to 
be worked out. He wanders in Dwarftown but still asks for the nominal
2500 gold piece fee (seemingly telepathically, probably a bug) after 
this. However, at this point, he can be lured off the level if he is
adjacent to a staircase, like any other inhabitant of Dwarftown. After
Glod is left on another level, his demands for payment cease. Note
that this may involve considerable tedium as the PC attempts to lure 
Glod off the level.<p>

It is possible to kill Glod (using acid spit or bolt spells while invisible, 
for instance) without making the rest of Dwarftown 
hostile (although Waldenbrook may become hostile), thus making his smithy 
available for free. One method of doing this involves using the greater daemon 
generated by Thrundarr's fifth quest. If the greater daemon is lured near Glod, 
it will kill Glod.<p>

<a name="257"></a><h4>2.5.7 The Green Griffon Inn</h4>
The Green Griffon Inn holds two useful NPCs described below. It is
located in the southeast corner of Dwarftown.<p>

<a name="2571"></a><h4>2.5.7.1 Bart</h4>
Bart provides teaching in three skills: Backstabbing, Tactics and Two 
Weapon Combat in exchange for the Golden Gladius, the artifact sword 
provided as a reward for winning the 20th Arena fight. Tactics is
available only from him.  He also provides some training in weapon 
skills, raising all zero level skills to level one and providing small 
bonuses to other weapon skils. The number of weapon marks that he
gives seems to be (Learning)d10. The training in weapon skills
is secondary as compared to granting the Tactics skill, which is of 
much greater importance in the game.<p>

<a name="2572"></a><h4>2.5.7.2 Torgall</h4>
Torgall is the innkeeper in the Green Griffon Inn.  He is a source of 
rumors, for the price of an ale.<p>

<a name="258"></a><h4>2.5.8 The Demented Ratling</h4>
The Demented Ratling is an important NPC for all PCs trying for a 
special ending. He demands to be fed six artifacts in exchange for
revealing the secret of the Stone Circle, where the Crown of Chaos can 
be found.  He will only talk to chaotic PCs. He becomes much more
powerful each time he is fed an artifact. This is important to remember.
If the PC is going to cause commotion in Dwarftown, for example in order 
to fulfill Kherab's second quest, it should only be done after feeding a 
number of artifacts to the demented ratling. Otherwise the demented
ratling may be killed in the ensuing battle for control of Dwarftown.<p>

The Demented Ratling gains 10 levels for each artifact he is fed. This increases his stats dramatically:<p>

<table border=1><caption>Demented ratling's stat increases</caption>

</table><p>

A wished-for demented ratling will make the usual demand for six 
artifacts from a chaotic PC, but will not eat an artifact. Instead, he 
responds with "Ya naw will neeta die!" He is not necessarily hostile 
after this. He responds in  the same way if the PC is fallen champion.<p>

It is possible to anger the demented ratling to the point where he will
attack by swapping places with him several times. Repeatedly (about five
times) talking to him after giving him artifacts will also make him hostile.<p>

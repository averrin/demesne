<h3>Short treatise on herbs</h3>

The patterns governing herb growth are well documented elsewhere, but it is
also quite easy to tell what kind of herb a given bush will produce. How?
It's determined by the line on the screen at which the bush appears. Using the
big room as a guide, the first screen line at which a floor or dungeon feature
can appear is line 5, whose herb bushes always produce morgia roots. The line
below that is home to moss of mareilon, and below that is the mighty
spenseweed. Curaria mancox/devil's roses are next, followed by alraunia
antidote/demon daisy, followed by stomafillia/stomacemptia, followed by pepper
petal/burb root. The line after pepper petal is morgia root again, and the
pattern repeats. Presented more visually (and best viewed in a monospaced
font):<pre>
(line no.
  mod 7)  type of herb found at that line
---------+--------------------------------
    5    | morgia root
    6    | moss of mareilon
    0    | spenseweed
    1    | curaria mancox/devil's rose
    2    | alraunia antidote/demon daisy
    3    | stomafillia/stomacemptia
    4    | pepper petal/burb root</pre>

If you don't know what "line number mod 7" means in the above chart, feel free
to ignore it. Just remember that the pattern starts with morgia root for the
topmost line at which herb bushes usually appear (barring any digging) and
repeat every seven lines. BTW, if you are like me in never remembering which
beneficial herbs are paired with demon daisies and devil's roses, remember the
"a" in "daisy" matches the "a"'s in "alraunia" and the "o" in "rose" matches
the "o" in "mancox." Kinda cheesy, but it works.<p>

On a standard 80x25 character screen, there are fifteen lines on which floors
and dungeon features may appear, yielding two complete repetitions of the
pattern with a bonus line of morgia root at the bottom. Lines 4, 20, and 21
may be burrowed to yield floors there too, and herb bushes can grow into these
lines once dug out if their growth patterns permit it. If you play on a larger
screen, use the "l"ook command to count down the line number of a given herb
bush, keeping in mind that the "look" cursor's topmost limit is line 3, which
would be stomafillia according to the pattern.<p>

It is sometimes possible to move herb bushes to the lines you want in order to
get a particularly desirable herb. You need four herb bushes in a "T" shape,
like this (again, view it in a monospaced font):

<pre>
...
"""
.".

When it's time for new bushes to grow, you'll get this pattern. . .

.".
"""
"""

. . .pick the bottom row clean. . .

.".
"""
...

. . . and wait for another generation to pass. . .

"""
"""
.".

Then harvest the bottom bush of each column to oblivion.

"""
.".
...

</pre><p>
Voila! The T has moved up a row. You can also use an inverted T to move
downward, or T's laid on their sides to move left or right. Once your T is in
the position you want, just pluck off one end of the crossbar to get the
ever-lovin' herb square. The process isn't risk-free, however. For one thing,
generations of herb growth are not always predictable, and you may find two
generations spawning in quick succession without giving you enough time in
between to overharvest the needed bushes. Another note: do this in a locked
room if you can. If you don't, the RNG *will* dump a wererat or a dark elven
spider factory into your lap at an inoppurtune moment, leaving you to hack and
slash through the bodies and miss perhaps several generations of herb growth.<p>

As for the overall usefulness of each herb--well, reasonable minds will differ.
Following are my own subjective opinions. Spenseweed, stomafillia, morgia root
and moss of mareilon are the top four, with a definite gap in usefulness
between them and curaria and alraunia, and another larger gap between those two
and pepper petal. I personally rate spenseweed and stomafillia at the top
because their utility never expires; you will *always* need healing and you
will *always* need food, but the stat gain twins stop increasing your stats at
a certain point. My non-troll characters go for spenseweed first, stomafillia
second; for trolls, the priorities are reversed. If only the two grew on
adjacent lines! Also, don't pass up the opportunity for a stat gain square,
ever, unless you absolutely must choose between morgia root and spenseweed.
Even then, morgia root *may* be the right choice, depending on how early it is
(early game, pick morgia, late, pick spenseweed, middle is a toss-up), your
race and class (mindcrafters and wizards love morgia, brawlers *need*
spenseweed), and how low your stats are now.<p>

In the middle tier, I prefer alraunia antidote in the *very* early game, as in
the initial dive from the SMC to the mountain village before my first spider
corpse. Once I'm no longer scared of pit vipers, my preference changes to
curaria mancox so as to safely increase my Mana score by munching on kobold
shaman. Last and in my mind least is pepper petal, which is inferior to
spenseweed in almost every way. Spenseweed's use by rubbing instead of
ingesting allows its use even while bloated, which will happen often if you're
on the Blessed stomafillia Diet Plan (TM). Pepper petal has an evil twin;
spenseweed doesn't. I've not observed any significant difference in healing
potency between blessed pepper petal and blessed spenseweed, but as I often
don't even bother to ID a bush I know will be pepper petal, I may have missed
it. Some may argue that pepper petal is preferable to spenseweed for a
starving character, but since stomafillia grows on the line above pepper
petal--i.e. the two are often found together--I don't consider that a
compelling argument.<p>

Please note that, in those crucial beginning turns, *any* benefical herb
(anything but the "evil twins") can save your life. If you see an herb bush by
its lonesome, fated to die next generation anyway, then for heaven's sake,
don't stop picking till you see the ground! Also, the Alchemy skill can add
new wrinkles to prioritizing one's herbs. If you happen to know a recipe for a
PoGA using only demon daisies and booze, then ignore the above paragraphs and
GO FOR IT, MAN! Remember that success in the Drakalor Chain often comes not by
memorizing a bunch of rules and patterns but by thinking on your feet!<p>

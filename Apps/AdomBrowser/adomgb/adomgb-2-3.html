<h3>The Big Room</h3>
The Big Room is found on level six or seven of the CoC. It is indeed one big room with
no walls. This means it is not possible to use corridors to restrict monster movement.
If there are many monsters present they can always swarm the PC. Breeders and summoners
are thus very dangerous on this level. If the PC does not have poison resistance this
level is exceptionally dangerous since dark elven wizards and dark elven priestesses who 
summon poisonous spiders are guaranteed to appear sooner or later. Breeders can get
completely out of control on this level. Even if they can't really hurt the PC, once a
high enough number breed and *continue* to breed the PC can't kill them as fast as they 
are being generated. Being trapped like this will lead to starvation eventually.
Remember that breeders can be sterilized by a scroll of vermin control or divine 
intervention.<p>

Herbs are guaranteed in the Big Room which leads to the dilemma of whether to stay and 
harvest herbs or flee from the constant onslaught of monsters.<p>

Petri Sihvola has discovered a way around this dilemma.

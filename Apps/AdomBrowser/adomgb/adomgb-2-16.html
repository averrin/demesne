<h3>The Water Temple</h3>
<A HREF="adomgb-2-16-pic.html" target="blank">Click here</A> for a color map of the water temple.<p>
The Water Temple, found on either D: 19 or D: 20, is  the first elemental 
temple that most PCs will encounter. The layout, on the left side
of the level, is as follows:<p>
<pre>
   ##########################            #######
  ##........................##           #.....#

</pre>
The right side of the level is random. Note that the temple itself is
disconnected. Entry must be made by digging. Teleportation is not allowed
on the level. Note the traps. Note the underscore in the center of the
temple. This is the chaotic elemental altar where the orb guardian is
found (at least until it is disturbed and moves). The elemental altars are
very dangerous. The temples are populated by sentient beings who will
sacrifice the PC instantly should he step on it. In addition, they can
only be converted by champions of Balance or Order, which means PCs going 
for an ultra ending cannot convert them early in the game, before retrieving 
the Medal of Chaos. The monsters in the Water Temple are arrayed as
follows:<p>
<pre>

They are: s - water snakes
          x - water grues
          & - water demons
          C - chaos servants
          E - water elementals
          s - (in the center) Snake from Beyond
</pre>
To attack the temple, the PC must dig in, then attack the monsters. It is not necessary
to cross the water although it is more convenient if this is possible. If the water
cannot be crossed the Snake can be zapped with a bolt from a wand or spell and will
eventually emerge. However, it may flee back across the water. Lure it to the previous
level before attacking. All the monsters are vulnerable to fire based attacks. The
grues and demons in particular are troublesome because they have a corrupting melee
attack that has a very high to-hit. Even PCs with very good DV will be hit by them
eventually - a good reason to develop the PCs missile weapon skills. The snakes,
including the Snake from Beyond, are poisonous. Invisibility is tremendously useful.
The only monster found here who sees invisible is the Snake from Beyond. None of
the monsters sees in Darkness.<p>

<a name="2g1"></a><h4>2.16.1 The Snake from Beyond</h4>
The Snake from Beyond has been beefed up in recent gammas and is now a 
formidable opponent. It generally does not kill a PC that has made it
this far, but has nasty poisonous and corrupting attacks that rarely 
miss. If possible, it should be killed from a distance, easier said
than done in the close quarters of the Water Temple. It is vulnerable
to demon slayers.<p>

An examination of the Snake from Beyond with a blessed stethoscope reveals:<p>
<pre>
You examine the Snake from Beyond. Diagnosis: Level: 1, DV: 45, PV: 22, 
Hits: 477, Attacks: 1, Damage: 12-56. Speed: 101.
</pre>
Very high hitpoints and formidable DV/PV for a PC at this level.<p>

The Snake from Beyond holds the Chaos Orb of Elemental Water, greater 
identified as follows:<p>
<pre>
----------------- uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Water {Wi+10}----------------

It is an artifact.

When used in melee combat it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 2d9+3 points
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 1d10+3
points of damage.

It modifies your willpower attribute by +10.
</pre>
(full heal + corruption when 'U'sed)<p>

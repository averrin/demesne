<h3>What kind of character is good for each starsign?</h3>
Check out the <a href="adomman-B.html#B2">ADOM Manual</a> for general game-related effect of starsigns.
Additional tips are provided here.<p>

<ol type="A">
<li>Raven<p>
The +10 to Speed is good for all PCs. It can save the life of low level
PCs who need to run away from a monster they can't handle. The "messengers
will reach you faster" refers to the delivery of the rune-covered trident, 
which happens faster for those born in this month, a nice bonus. The "harder
to trick by deceptions" grants resistance to confusion attacks by dopplegangers.
The stronger companions characteristic makes this month excellent for <b>Bards</b>.
The Raven birthsign gives you a 75% chance to evade a doppleganger's confusion attack.<p>

<li>Book <p>
Lawful tendencies is a weak effect. One free skill increase each level helps 
all PCs, especially those with low learning. Increased chance to learn spells
means borderline casters have a better chance. This is not the ideal month for
a Wizard - they are already great at learning spells. More suited to
<b>elven fighting classes</b> or a <b>Dwarvish Paladin</b>. The Book birthsign 
decreases alignment changes towards chaotic by 10%.<p>

<li>Wand <p>
Here we have the sign for a <b>neutral Wizard</b>. Gray Elven Wizards are ideal
with their naturally high Mana and neutral alignment. They are somewhat
difficult to keep alive in the early game but become enormously powerful in 
the mid- and endgame. The Wand birthsign decreases alignment changes towards chaotic
by 10%.<p>

<li>Unicorn <p>
Generic sign with resistance to corruption. Pretty attractive for any PC 
going for an ultra ending, especially an aspiring <b>Avatar of Order</b>. The fact 
that lawful alignment is difficult to change means such a PC can commit a 
few chaotic acts and get away with it without becoming a fallen champion. 
Also nice for an aspiring (ultimate) <b>Chaos God</b>, since crowned chaotics are
corrupted more rapidly than others. The Unicorn birthsign reduces corruption by 19% if
you are L, by 37% if L+, and increases it by 30% for C-. Due to a bug, it also 
increases alignment changes towards chaotic by 20%.<p>

<li>Salamander <p>
Very attractive for <b>Elementalists</b>, who rely on a lot of fire magic. Not
half bad for a <b>Necromancer</b> who finds some fire-based spellbooks, either.
Necromancers need that +3 to Mana.<p>

<li>Dragon <p>
<b>Fighters</b>. The +1 to Toughness is not significant - that is within the
variability for the stat for identical race/class PCs. The -3 to Willpower
is significant and makes this unattractive for those who need it in the early 
game - Wizards, Mindcrafters. Not a bad month for <b>Paladins</b> with both weapon
and combat magic costs reduced.<p>

<li>Sword <p>
Learning bonus is insignificant, although it can push a PC from illiterate to 
literate. The 20% reduction in cost to train melee weapon skills makes this 
attractive for a PC that really wants to become super-proficient with a weapon. 
Not a bad choice for <b>Rangers</b> who start the game dual wielding swords.<p>

<li>Falcon <p>
Grants the Survival skill to any character. This skill is generally considered as
being of little use (see section <a href="adomgb-0-4.html">0.4</a>).
The Willpower bonus is somewhat useful for
spellcasters and <b>Mindcrafters</b>, although better starsigns exist for those classes.
The Charisma bonus is of little significance for any character, with the possible
exception of <b>Bards, Necromancers and male Merchants</b>. The free talent is good for
all PCs, especially for gnomish and hurthling Bards, as it guarantees them both
a very useful Heir gift and the possibility to go for the Treasure Hunter talent.<p>

<li>Cup <p>
Another sign for <b>Wizards</b>. Higher Learning to start and the 10% reduction to
gain a level means they advance rapidly, which is very helpful in keeping them 
alive at low level. The 20% effectivity increase in learning spells also helps 
keep them alive in the early game, while the player has not had time to raise 
their Learning score.<p>

<li>Candle <p>
This can be an unbelievable sign for <b>Trolls</b>. They heal rapidly anyway, but those
born in this month almost don't need the Healing skill! Almost. Get it and they 
seem to have natural regeneration. Playing a <b>trollish Healer</b> born in this month
is almost cheating. ;-) Candle-born characters are guaranteed to heal 2 hitpoints 
every 12 turns.<p>

<li>Wolf <p>
Significant benefits to Perception and Willpower. The Willpower is good for
<b>Wizards</b> and <b>Mindcrafters</b>, of course. Races that start with lower Perception
include <b>Dwarves, Orcs</b> and of course <b>Trolls</b>.<p>

<li>Tree <p>
Made for <b>Mindcrafters</b>, who really need that +5 to Willpower in the early game.
Not bad for <b>Wizards</b> either. The Tree birthsign reduces all alignment changes by 10%.<p>

<h3>The Water Dragon's Lair</h3>
<A HREF="adomgb-2-13-pic.html" target="blank">Click here</A> for a color map of the Water Dragon's Lair.<p>
The water dragon's lair is located in a random water-containing 
square of the wilderness. It contains Shyssiryxius, the water
dragon (Blup's mother), her treasure hoard and various other 
aquatic beasts. It consists of a labyrinth and a central room
containing Shyssiryxius and the treasure. The entire cave is
submerged, so ordinarily some means of water breathing and the 
Swimming skill are required. The most common method of obtaining 
water breathing is through a helm of water breathing (generally a 
"blue helmet" before identification). Wearing two rings of the
fish also grants this, although they are autocursing. If the PC
is not born with the Swimming skill, it can be obtained from Blup 
by giving him potions of carrot juice. The need for these
abilities ordinarily keeps low level PCs out of the lair, which is 
as it should be. The aquatic beasts found in the labyrinth are
not trivial, especially the dragon turtles. Sharks and giant eels
can also be found. None of these monsters see invisible.<p>

In theory a PC with on demand teleportation, high hit points and 
possibly some regeneration could survive a teleport to 
Shyssiryxius, a chat and a teleport to the up stairs without water 
breathing or Swimming.<p>

There are two main reasons for entering. The first is to 'C'hat
with Shyssiryxius then return to Terinyo. This allows the PC to
inform Blup about the location of his mother, which results in 
eventual delivery of the rune-covered trident, a decent artifact 
weapon and missile, later in the game. The trident is delivered
not long after reaching character level 16 for PCs born in the 
Raven starsign. Others have to wait until level 36. The location
of the lair is not decided until the PC starts searching for it, 
so it is more or less possible to place it in a convenient location, 
such as near Terinyo.<p>

The second reason for entering the lair is to loot it. There are
occasionally outstanding items found in the treasure hoard. As
might be expected, Shyssiryxius does not take kindly to thieves 
and will attack. She does not see in Darkness, however. Cast
Darkness over desired item(s), pick them up and leave.<p>

Note that delivery of the rune-covered trident is guaranteed once 
the PC informs Blup of Shyssiryxius' location. The PC may then
proceed to loot the cave, or indeed even kill Shyssiryxius without 
forfeiting the rune-covered trident.<p>

Monsters tamed in the underwater cave can leave with the PC and
breathe air. This is probably a game bug.<p>

<a name="2d1"></a><h4>2.13.1 Shyssiryxius</h4>
Under normal circumstances, Shyssiryxius is not hostile, only 
intimidating. If she is 'C'hatted with, she roars "HAST YE SEEN
MY BABY?" (or "*DIE*" if the PC has done something to make her 
hostile). Whether she is hostile or not, the PC can leave after
chatting and report back to Blup. This of course assumes a PC
facing her when she is hostile survives (see below). If the PC
attempts to steal from her treasure hoard, she gives a warning 
about not picking anything up. If the PC persists, she will attack.
She is a formidable opponent with a reasonably powerful melee attack 
and a deadly water breath attack that is capable of dealing circa 
100 points of damage in a single round. Sources of water breathing
will reduce the damage of this attack.
She regenerates and is immune to cold. She is capable of teleporting and does so when
she panics, making the PC work to find her while remaining 
underwater the whole time. She can be killed, but it takes an
upper level PC, and it doesn't hurt to have some blessed potions 
of extra healing along. Note that Shyssiryxius, like certain other 
powerful monsters, is unable to fight in Darkness unless panicked. She is
also vulnerable to poison.<p>

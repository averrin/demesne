<a name="0e"></a><h3>Tips and tricks</h3>
<a name="0e1"></a><h4>0.14.1 Recharging wands</h4>
There are many ways to recharge a depleted wand. The common ways are to dip the wand 
into an appropriate potion or read a scroll of charging. Only the type of potion and 
its status affects the number of charges. The type, status and rusty/nonrusty nature of 
the wand do not matter.
See the table below for some results compiled by Petri Sihvola:<p>

<a name="0e11"></a><table border=1><caption>Recharging wands</caption>
<th>Potion or scroll<th>Status<th>Trials<th>Average charges<th>Min/Max charges<th>Dice
<tr><td rowspan=3><b>Boost mana</b><td>Blessed<td>60<td>5.8<td>3/9 <td>3d3

</table><p>

Remember that a potentially endless supply of booze is available from beggars in Lawenilothehl.
Give them 50 gold pieces, then 'C'hat with them and they will often drop a potion of booze.
Only one per beggar, though, so those who have given up their potion need to be killed (alignment hit)
or led into the wilderness to encourage more beggar generation. Get rid of all the other random monsters
in the town to further encourage monster generation.<p>

Potions of raw mana do *not* work. Note that potions of mana can be used to permanently 
increase the PCs Mana stat; the player may want to save them for that purpose.
Wizards can also recharge wands at level 32, only once per wand though.
Wands of wishing can't be recharged. For these, you'll want to use the chance to wrench 
a final charge from the wand, destroying it.
See also potions of raw chaos below.<p>

<a name="0e2"></a><h4>0.14.2 Huge rocks and anvils</h4>
These heavy items have a nice use: crashing doors. Throw one at a door and
enjoy the sight of a broken door before you. This is not guaranteed; it seems
to be Strength dependent. There is a very nice side
benefit to this: any trap that the door was protected with is destroyed 
along with the door. The trap does not go off as it is destroyed.<p>

In addition, huge rocks can be used to keep ants from escaping anthills. 
Whenever an ant wants to escape, you get a message like "The uncursed huge rock 
(-10, 10d6) seems to be shaking.". Eventually the huge rock is destroyed 
("Something from below destroys the uncursed huge rock (-10, 10d6)!") 
and ants can come out of the hole again. Sometimes this happens after 
only a few turns, sometimes it takes more than a hundred. Multiple huge 
rocks are destroyed one after the other and thus last longer than a 
single one.<p>

<a name="0e3"></a><h4>0.14.3 Statues</h4>
If your PC is really, really buff, a statue can be wielded as a melee 
weapon, but the real use for statues is to kick it until it breaks down, 
making it yield a magical wand. Statues can be generated by petrifying 
enemies.<p>

Stephen White has done some research on 
the b/u/c status of statues re wand generation. His PC kicked 200 statues 
with each status to pieces. The results were as follows:<p>
<ul>
<li>Blessed statues: 62 wands generated, about 1/3<br>
<li>Uncursed statues: 17 wands generated, about 1/10<br>
<li>Cursed statues: 3 wands generated, about 1/100<p>
</ul><p>

<a name="0e4"></a><h4>0.14.4 Potions of raw chaos</h4>
Items can be dipped in potions of raw chaos in order to transform them into new ones, but will not make wands of wishing
or rings of djinni summoning. Everything created will be cursed. Dipping items (other than artifacts)
into a PoRC will transform it into a random item of the same type - useful for brass items. Equipped items are removed
(even if cursed) and cursed. There is a chance of spilling the potion, though, which corrupts the PC (spilling happens if 
1d(Dx+10) > Dx). Worse is the
possibility of transforming an item into the exact same item. This causes an explosion which badly corrupts the PC,
about 5 corruptions (100d100 CP's), and causes 10d30 of damage. Needless to say, this can kill a low-level PC.
Dipping a scroll of chaos resistance into potion of raw chaos causes a massive explosion of 13d13 damage, producing message 
death message 'was ripped apart when confronting Order and Chaos'. <p>

PoRC will only create items of a danger level that corresponds to the level on which you dip the item. 
For creating an amulet of lifesaving, you should dip amulets on DL2. Your odds are poor - 1.08%. You can safely dip amulets of balance, 
free action, health, hunger, luck, chaos, order, speed, teleport control, cold hearts, water breathing, silver tongue, and mana.<p>

Wands dipped into a PoRC will turn into a wand with a different number of charges. This is one way to recharge wands with
0 charges left. The type of wand, however, is unpredictable.<p>

A heap of items that are dipped into a potion of raw chaos will always transform into a single item. Potions of raw chaos
can be created by dipping any corrupting artifact (those containing the essence of chaos and corruption + Moon Sickle)
into any ordinary potion.<p>

<a name="0e5"></a><h4>0.14.5 Potions of exchange</h4>
In addition to swapping stats, these can polymorph monsters when thrown. Blessed potions can polymorph items to another of the
same type. Spellbooks are always transformed into non-spellbooks and vice versa.
The item produced will be appropriate for the danger level where the dipping takes place. This is the basis of
ring-based wish engines. Once one has blessed potions of exchange stacks of 19 rings can be dipped, potentially producing
19 rings of djinni summoning. These in turn are enough to produce 57 more potions of exchange on average. Since used rings
of djinni summoninng become brass rings, additional rings do not have to be wished for. The PC may have to throw in some wishes
for potions of water to keep blessing the potions of exchange. Of course once the engine starts there are enough spare wishes
to actually get some things that matter as well. :-).<p>

<a name="0e6"></a><h4>0.14.6 Regeneration of HP and PP</h4>
When drinking potions of insight or casting the Revelation spell, there
is some information about Power Point and Hit Point regeneration. Those
two values lie between 5 and 200: the lower the number, the faster the
regeneration. But there are 2 variables connected to regeneration: RegenRate and RegenAmount.
RegenRate is how often (in turns) you heal - this value is revealed via revelation or insight;
RegenAmount is how much - this value is completely hidden.<p>

Regeneration occurs at the same rate whether walking around or resting. 
RegenRate is measured in *turns*, not game time. High speed or seven league 
boots lead to exactly the same regeneration rate in turns. Thus regeneration 
is faster with respect to game time if the PC is fast or walking around with 
seven league boots. If a PC with low walking energy cost wants to spend the 
minimum amount of game time regenerating, the best bet is to walk around 
while regenerating. The Cursed, Doomed, Lucky and Fate smiles intrinsics do not make a
difference for regeneration purposes. Hunger status has no effect on regeneration.<p>

<a name="0e61"></a><h4>0.14.6.1 HP regeneration</h4>
<a name="0e601"></a><table border=1><caption>Natural HP regeneration</caption>
<tr><th>Condition <th>NaturalRegen
<tr><td>Human, Hurthling <td> 50
<tr><td>Dark Elf<td> 70
<tr><td>Gray Elf<td> 65
<tr><td>High Elf<td> 60
<tr><td>Gnome <td> 48
<tr><td>Dwarf <td> 45
<tr><td>Orc<td> 40
<tr><td>Drakeling <td> 30
<tr><td>Troll <td> 20
<tr><td>Healer <td> halved
<tr><td>most PC's <td> -1 (based on Toughness?)
<tr><td>some PC's <td> -1 once more (based on Toughness?)
</table><p>

The modifiers are applied in the order listed here.
E.g. Trollish Healers with exceptional Toughness get a starting
regeneration time of 20 / 2 - 1 - 1 = 8. <p>

RegenRate = Max (2, NaturalRegen *10 if Sick *0.8 if Healthy talent *1/0.5/0.125 if wearing C/U/B necklace
of rapid healing) *10 if wearing rotting armor.<p>

The Healing skill provides additional chance for regeneration every turn: (Healing / (1200 *4.67 if Sick))%.
So with 100 Healing the chance is 0.83% per turn (0.39% if sick). The Candle birthsign provides additional regeneration every 12 turns.<p>

RegenAmount = 1 + ClassBonus + CandleBonus + RoomBonus. ClassBonus is 1 for lvl 6-11 Healers, lvl 32+ Bards, lvl 32+ 
Druids in wilderness, 2 for lvl 12+ Healers, 0 otherwise. CandleBonus is 1 for Candle borns, 0 otherwise. RoomBonus is 3
if in "refreshing" room, 1 if in "herbs and antiseptics" room, 0 otherwise.<p> 

Separate from these RegenRate and RegenAmount calculations, every piece of regenerating equipment (except amulet of rapid healing) grants 
additional 1 HP per turn. The regenerating corruption grants additional 1 HP every 5 turns, but 1 scar every 1000 regenerations (-1 Dx or -1 Ap).<p>

All HP regeneration is stopped, if the PC is in the "devoid of all life" room, or in water without water breathing.<p>
 
<a name="0e62"></a><h4>0.14.6.2 PP regeneration</h4>
<a name="0e602"></a><table border=1><caption>Natural PP regeneration</caption>
<tr><th>Condition <th>NaturalRegen
<tr><td>Human, Drakeling<td> 50
<tr><td>Troll<td> 100
<tr><td>Dwarf<td> 90
<tr><td>Hurthling<td> 60
<tr><td>Orc<td> 55
<tr><td>High Elf<td> 40
<tr><td>Gnome<td> 40
<tr><td>Dark Elf<td> 30
<tr><td>Gray Elf<td> 25
<tr><td>most PC's<td> -1 (based on Mana?)
<tr><td>some PC's<td> -1 once more (based on Mana?)
</table><p>

PP regeneration is applied every turm if one the following checks pass:
<ul>
<li>TurnNumber mod NaturalRegen = 0 (once every NaturalRegen turns)
<li>Concentration > 1d500
<li>Concentration >= 75 and Concentration > 1d500
<li>Concentration >= 90 and Concentration > 1d500
<li>Concentration = 100 and Concentration > 1d500 (100 Concentration provides about 59% overall chance)
<li>Charged talent and 3%
<li>the PC is in magical island in Terinyo and 100% (means the island grants PP regeneration every turn)
<li>Mana battery corruption and 10%
</ul><p>

RegenAmount = 1 + ClassBonus. ClassBonus is 1 for lvl 40+ Bards and lvl 12+ Druids in wilderness, 0 otherwise.<p>

All PP regeneration is stopped if wearing anti-magical armor.<p>

<a name="0e63"></a><h4>0.14.6.3 Potions of troll blood and raw mana</h4>
Natural regeneration can be affected by drinking potions of troll blood (for 
hit points) or potions of raw mana (for power points). 
These potions cannot lower RegenRate below 5 turns or raise it above 200.
Their effectiveness depends on their blessed/uncursed/cursed status:<p>

<a name="0e621"></a><table border=1><caption>Potions of troll blood and raw mana</caption>
<tr><th>Potion status <th> Modification to RegenRate
<tr><td>blessed <td> -4d3
<tr><td>uncursed <td> -2d3
<tr><td>cursed <td> +2d3
</table><p>

Bottom line: always bless your potions of troll blood or raw mana.<p>

As can be seen, many blessed potions of troll blood will get you more
than good healing skill, but having Healing at 100 is best. Likewise,
potions of raw mana are nice, but not as important as having a high
Concentration skill.<p>

<a name="0e64"></a><h4>0.14.6.4 Troll corpses</h4>
There are four types of troll corpses (troll, troll berserker, troll 
chief, troll king). They all yield either of two messages when eaten by 
a non-troll:<p>

<a name="0e631"></a><ol type="a">
<li>"Urg! Foul meat! Your blood suddenly courses faster through your veins!"
<li>"Urg! Foul meat!"
</ol><p>

Message a. indicates that natural HP regeneration decreased by one<br>
Message b. indicates that natural HP regeneration did not change<p>

For Troll PCs, the messages are slightly modified:<p>

<a name="0e632"></a><ol type="a">
<li> "Yum! Your blood suddenly courses faster through your veins!"
<li> "Yum!"
</ol><p>

The behaviour is the same: a. decreases natural HP regeneration, b. does not.<p>

No corpse can reduce the regeneration time below 6. Trying this always 
gives b. message. This differs from potions of 
troll blood, which always result in the "Your blood suddenly curses 
faster..." message, even if the regeneration time is already minimal. 
Note that the lower threshold is 6, unlike the threshold for potions of 
troll blood, which is 5. This means that Trolls, who cannot make use of 
potions of troll blood, cannot lower their regeneration time to 5, 
unlike the other races.<p>

The probabilities of getting a decrease in regeneration time depends 
only on the B/U/C status of the corpse. Specifically, it does not 
depend on:<p>

<a name="0e633"></a><ul>
<li> Current regeneration time (no difference between the lowest 
eligible value 7 and the unrealistically high value 200)
<li> PC race (Human vs. Troll)
<li> Cooked/uncooked status
<li> Type of troll corpse (troll, troll berserker, troll chief, troll king)
</ul><p>

Results indicate that blessed corpses work in 100% of the cases 
(although, like all corpses, they cannot lower it below 6), and uncursed 
or cursed corpses work in 50% of the cases. There was no observable 
difference between uncursed and cursed corpses:<p>

<a name="0e634"><ul>
<li>94 blessed troll corpses: 94x decrease
<li>621 uncursed troll corpses: 314x decrease, 307x no decrease
<li>361 cursed troll corpses: 187x decrease, 174x no decrease
</ul><p>

There was no difference in weight or satiation value of the various kinds 
of troll corpses. All corpses weigh 240s if not cooked, irrespective of 
B/U/C (rotting) status, and 228s (= 5% less) if cooked, again irrespective 
of B/U/C (rotting) status.<p>

An uncursed corpse yields 500 units of satiation (like a large ration). 
This is doubled if the corpse is cooked (presumably this holds for other 
corpses too, but this needs further verification). The resulting value 
is modified by +25% for blessed corpes and -50% for cursed corpses, just 
like for other food items. So, e.g. a blessed cooked troll chief corpse 
gives 500 * 2 * 1.25 = 1250 units of satiation.<p>

<a name="0e635"></a><b>Summary</b><p>
<ul>
<li>Item: [troll/troll berserker/troll chief/troll king] corpse<br>
<li>Weight: 240s (-5% if cooked)<br>
<li>Nutritional value: 500 (*2 if cooked, *1.25 if blessed, *0.5 if cursed)<br>
<li>Effect when eaten [blessed]: If natural HP regeneration is >= 7, it is reduced by 1<br>
<li>Effect when eaten [uncursed/cursed]: If natural HP regeneration is >= 7, it is reduced by 1 with a probability of 50%<br>
<li>Message when eaten [non-troll PC]: "Urg! Foul meat!"<br>
<li>Message when eaten [Troll PC]: "Yum!"<br>
<li>Additional message if and only if natural HP regeneration was reduced: "Your blood suddenly courses faster through your veins!"<p>
</ul><p>

<a name="0e7"></a><h4>0.14.7 Freezing water</h4>
Pretty straightforward: use some cold source while standing next to 
a water square and zap over it. Frost/Nether Bolt, Ice Ball/Freezing 
Fury, or a wand of cold qualify. Ice is fragile, of course, and 
there's a 2000 stone limit for your stuff's weight. Exploding ice 
vortices will freeze all water in the range of their blast. Likewise, 
monsters that cast Frost Bolt, Ogre Magi for instance, can freeze water. 
However, monsters that breathe ice, white dragons for example, do not 
freeze anything when their breath crosses water (probably a bug).<p>

<a name="0e8"></a><h4>0.14.8 Safe places to store items</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>The top line of the Terinyo map</b><br>
The only monster in Terinyo that can step on the top line is the sheriff,
and he can easily be lured to the first level of the puppy cave. It is then
100% secure. Skriek can step on the top line as well, if one lures him there.<p>

<li><b>Locked rooms</b><br>
Locked rooms are one of the safest places to leave items in ADOM. 
With the current state of the monster inventory system (they can 
pick up items but not use them), a monster will never be able to 
unlock a door. Several monsters can smash doors, however. Some 
monsters (balors spring to mind) can teleport into locked rooms.<p>

<li><b>The Old Barbarian's glade</b><br>
The Old Barbarian's glade is a decent place to store items. He is 
the only monster ever generated in this location, so nothing randomly 
generated is going to run away with the PC's stuff. If the PC leaves 
items far away from the Old Barbarian, he will not have time to find 
them prior to the PC's next visit.<p>

<li><b>The Mad Minstrel's clearing</b><br>
In ADOM 1.0.0, the Mad Minstrel will leave his hut, and will pick up 
items. The safety re storage is therefore similar to the Old 
Barbarian's glade. No other monsters are generated in his clearing,
so leaving items far away from the Mad Minstrel should not allow him 
time to find them prior to the PC's next visit.<p>

<li><b>The Dwarven Mystic's room in Dwarftown</b><br>
The ultimate in security, if the PC has not destroyed it with a wand 
of destruction (see section <a href="adomgb-2-5.html#254">2.5.4</a>). 
After 'C'hatting wih the Dwarven 
Mystic, he disappears, leaving a 2 x 2 room that cannot be entered 
except by teleportation. Since there are no teleporting monsters 
found in Dwarftown (except for the greater daemon - kill it) this is 
as safe as storage areas get. Other Dwarftown inhabitants can, in 
extremely rare circumstances, be generated in this room. Since they 
will be nonhostile, killing them is not a good idea. Teleport them 
out if possible. Alternatively, use the Ogre Cave (see below).<p>

<li><b>The Ogre Cave in Dwarftown</b><br>
Once the Ogre Cave is cleared, monster generation there is slow or 
nonexistent. Items can be left adjacent to the stairway. If the PC 
leaves immediately, no time passes on the level, so there should be 
almost no chance the items will be disturbed.<p>

<li><b>The secret room in the HMV</b><br>
Another room accessible only by teleportation, therefore almost 
perfect theoretical security. A monster teleporting into this 
room has never been seen. In extremely rare circumstances, however, 
monsters can be generated in this room. They may well be hostile, 
so killing them is a simple solution. Teleporting them out is a 
worthwhile alternative.<p>

<li><b>Sharad-Waador's room</b><br>
Items left in Sharad-Waador's room never seem to be disturbed. 
Sharad-Waador never moves from the square where he is initially 
generated (unless he is attacked or the PC reneges on the deal to 
take the quest), and no time passes on the level between the PC's 
departure and reemergence from the blue dragon caves. This is very 
important, since the player may want to leave important non-artifact 
equipment behind in order to avoid its potential destruction in the 
blue dragon caves (see section <a href="adomgb-3-9.html">3.9</a>).<p>
</ul><p>

<a name="0e9"></a><h4>0.14.9 Seven league boots</h4>
Seven league boots can dramatically reduce the time needed to walk around
in the wilderness, depending on their blessed/uncursed/cursed status:<p>
<ul>
<li>blessed: time needed for walking is divided by 6
<li>uncursed: time needed for walking is divided by 3
<li>cursed: time needed for walking is multiplied by 2
</ul><p>

Blessed/uncursed/cursed seven league boots also alter the base energy cost 
for movement outside the wilderness from 1000 to 500/750/1500, respectively.
The Long Stride talent stacks, reducing base energy cost further.
Seven league boots should be blessed immediately. They enable the PC to 
outrun anything other than quicklings. Consequently, some players regard 
seven league boots as the most important item in the game, and will use a 
wish to obtain them, if necessary.<p>

<a name="0ea"></a><h4>0.14.10 Stethoscopes</h4>
'U'sing a stethoscope, you can determine a monster's statistics
precisely. Furthermore, using a stethoscope, you can easily find secret
doors: scan a wall block, and if it "sounds hollow", it's a secret door.
In addition to monsters and secret doors, stethoscopes can also be used on closed 
doors to find out the number of monsters behind it. The messages are:<p>

<a name="0ea1"></a><table border=1><caption>Stethoscope messages</caption>
<tr><th>Message<th>Meaning
<tr><td>"Silence." <td> corridor (this message is shown even if the corridor is full of monsters, so be warned)
<tr><td>"You hear nothing." <td> empty room
<tr><td>"You hear some low-volume sounds." <td> 1 monster in the room
<tr><td>"You hear some sounds." <td> 2-3 monsters
<tr><td>"You hear many sounds." <td> 4-8 monsters
<tr><td>"You hear lots of sounds." <td> 9 or more monsters (tension rooms and rooms filled with breeders or summoned creatures also give this message)
</table><p>

See section 0.14.11 below concerning a Healer's special ability with stethoscopes.<p>

<a name="0eb"></a><h4>0.14.11 Undocumented character abilities</h4>
<ul>
<li>All characters gain to-hit and to-damage bonuses when fighting as a true 
berserker, which means no armor can be worn and Tactics must be set to 
berserk. Shields are acceptable, any worn armor is not. Level 40 and 
higher Barbarians get additional bonuses on top of this when fighting as 
a true berserker. Note that Monks do not seem to receive this true berserker bonus.
<li>Monks gain the ability to kick down walls at experience level 13.
<li>Merchants always specialize in a certain item: potions, rings, scrolls, 
or wands. This specialization allows them to identify any item in that 
category on sight.
<li> Merchants get additional bonuses to throwing coins (+level to hit,
+level/2+3 to damage). Dopplegangers cannot deflect a merchant's thrown coins.
The coin throw action costs 1200 energy points as opposed to the normal 1000. Getting the
Quick Shot talent does apply to the coin throw attack, bringing it to 1080. The coin throw
attack is not capable of receiving weapon marks, nor does it benefit from the Strong Thrower
talent. The Archery skill is not trained by coin throwing. Coin throwing does benefit from
a high Dexterity stat, rings of slaying, archery gloves, the Good Shot talent, the Keen Shot
talent, the Quick Shot talent, the Missile Weapon Master talent, and the Find Weakness skill.
Coin throw attacks start out with a range of only 3, but at exp. level 10, it increases to 5,
and increases a further +2 with each 10 experience levels gained.
<li>Healers have the ability to use a stethoscope without consuming any game
time. All other classes consume one turn of game time when using a 
stethoscope.
<li>Archers have a unique ability to dodge missiles. When a missile misses any other
class PC, it simply stops at the PC's square. Missiles often fly past Archers. This is
actually probably undesirable since Archers want to pick up those missiles, but it is
nevertheless an undocumented unique ability.
</ul><p>

<a name="0ec"></a><h4>0.14.12 The weight and appearance of objects</h4>
Note the weight of objects. Many valuable objects have a unique weight. 
For instance, there is only one type of sword with a weight of 35s, one 
amulet weighing 7s, one amulet weighing 8s, one girdle weighing 30s, etc. 
In general, lighter items are better. Items with odd, unusual or rare 
weights are often better than their more commonly observed counterparts.
Certain special items are also have a unique color. Slaying quarrels will 
be brown rather than the silver of normal quarrels. Metal-shod quarterstaves 
(whether iron-, mithril-, adamantium- or eternium-) are silver; normal 
quarterstaves are brown. This is especially important to remember for 
eternium-shod quarterstaves, since they have the same weight as wooden 
quarterstaves.<p>

<a name="0ed"></a><h4>0.14.13 Smithing</h4>
Taken from <a href="http://www.adomgb.info/adomfaq.html">Official ADOM FAQ</a>:<p>

Smithing is a complicated task. You need the following ingredients: <p>
<ol>
<li>Any kind of hammer
<li>An anvil. There are two guaranteed in the game (kill Kherab and Glod), but 
they also rarely appear in dungeons
<li>Something to smith! You need to know what kind of metal it's made of (use Metallurgy)
<li>An ingot of the appropriate metal. A lump of ore won't cut it, but can be converted 
into ingots by applying the Smithing skill to it first. Generate some lumps by Mining.
<li>A forge. You can't carry these around with you, but you can hope to find one in your
travels. There are two locations in the game where forges are guaranteed (Dwarftown and
Darkforge), and there can be additional forges at random locations
</ol>
Stand on the forge, wield the hammer, and apply your Smithing skill to your metal item.
This will also serve to make metal ingots out of ore lumps. It's rumored that wearing
a leather apron helps in some mysterious way.<p>

Other useful facts regarding Smithing:<p>
<ul>
<li>An easy way to train Smithing is by removing rust. Low risk of damaging the item, no lost ingots, 
and easy to get rusty items with a river or a water trap. Also quite fast. 
<li>Glod charges exactly 2500gp in all cases, and only if he is on the current level, for the use of his forge. 
Killing him, luring him off the level, and turning him into a writhing mass of primal chaos will all stop the demands; making him hostile won't. 
<li>The Smithing skill costs a base 5000gp from Glod, 5250 if female. If you have very high Charisma, you get a discount; 1% per 1 Ch over 15. 
Being cursed doubles the price, doomed triple, being Troll doubles, being Orc quadruples, all cumulative. 
<li>You need a hammer wielded in either hand and an anvil in inventory and equipment to smith. If multiple such items apply, the best by BUC is used. 
The following items count as hammers: large eternium hammer, large mithril hammer, large adamantium hammer, huge iron hammer, eternium warhammer, warhammer, 
adamantium warhammer, mithril warhammer, hammer of the gods, large hammer. 
<li>You can do three things with a smithing setup - smelt ore, remove rust, and improve items. 
<li>Teleportitis does not occur during smithing sessions. 
<li>Smithing is influenced by the statuses of all involved items (hammer, anvil, worked item, and ingot if applicable). BUCMod in the below formulas means 
+10 per cursed item and -10 per blessed item. 
<li>You can never smith artifacts.
</ul><p> 

<a name="0ed1"></a><h4>0.14.13.1 Smelting ore</h4>
<ul>
<li>Takes 25 turns (even for Weaponsmiths). If you are interrupted, the ore is lost. 
<li>Let Difficulty = BUCMod + 0/-5/-10/-20 by ore material (iron/mithril/adamantium/eternium - better materials are easier). 
<li>If Smithing >= 1d(110+Difficulty), you now have an ingot (10/80/10 B/U/C and 2% chance of rusty if iron) instead of the ore. 
<li>Otherwise, you fail. Normally you keep the ore. There is a Difficulty+1 in Smithing*4 chance of losing the ore.
</ul><p>

<a name="0ed2"></a><h4>0.14.13.2 Removing rust</h4>
<ul>           
<li>Takes 25 turns, or 6 for level 12+ Weaponsmiths. Being interrupted has no lasting effects. 
<li>If Smithing >= 1d(110+BUCMod), you remove the rust. 
<li>Otherwise, nothing happens. There is a BUCMod+1 in Smithing*4 chance of the item becoming broken.
</ul><p>

<a name="0ed3"></a><h4>0.14.13.3 Improving items</h4> 
<ul>
<li>Requires an ingot of the same material as the work item, which is consumed in the process.
<li>Requires (200 - Smithing) turns (one-quarter that for level 12+ Weaponsmiths). Being interrupted has no lasting effects and does not consume an ingot.
<li>If the item is broken, you will attempt to fix it. Succeed if 120 + BUCMod < Smithing. No penalty on failure. 
<li>Otherwise, you attempt to increase the item's stats. This is a two-step process; first you must pass a Smithing check to improve the item at all, 
then the amount by which the item is improved is determined. Improvement amounts are determined only by the item's existing stats, not by skill. 
If you fail the Smithing check, "You fail to improve the -item-". If you pass it but zero improvement is rolled, "Despite your best efforts the quality 
of the -item- does not improve.". Otherwise, "You manage to improve the -item-.". 
<li>The difficulty of the check is determined as follows: 
<ul>
 <li>Start with Difficulty equal to BUCMod. 
 <li>If the item is a weapon, add 12 times the sum of the absolute values of the to-hit and to-damage numbers (X and Y in (+X, 1d4+Y)). 
 <li>Otherwise, add 18 times the sum of the absolute values of the DV and PV numbers. 
 <li>If you are a Weaponsmith of any level and Difficulty is positive, divide it by 2. Otherwise, add 20. 
 <li>Subtract your experience level. 
 <li>Final Difficulty is 120 + Difficulty, with a minimum of 120.
</ul> 
<li>Supposing you pass the test (Smithing >= 1dDifficulty), the amounts and types of increase depend on the item's class. 
<li>For melee and missile weapons:
<ul> 
 <li>Increase to-hit by 1d4 if to-hit is less than 9 and one chance in the (absolute value of to-hit or 2, whichever is larger). 
 <li>Increase to-damage by 1d4 if to-damage is less than 9 and one chance in the (absolute value of to-damage or 2, whichever is larger), and to-hit was not increased. 
 <li>For melee weapons only, increase the DV modifier by 1 if it is no more than 3 more than the base DV modifier of the weapon type, and neither to-hit nor to-damage were increased. 
</ul>
<li>For helmets, armor, girdles, shields, bracers, gauntlets, and boots:
<ul>
 <li>Increase DV by 1d3 if it is less than 6 more than the base value OR on a one-in-(3 + 2*abs(DV)) chance. 
 <li>Increase PV by 1d3 if it is less than 4 more than the base value OR on a one-in-(3 + 2*abs(PV)) chance, and DV was not increased. 
</ul>
<li>All other item types cannot be improved.
</ul><p>  

<a name="0ee"></a><h4>0.14.14 Darkness</h4>
Thanks to gut for this section.<p>
 
Darkness is one of the most useful options available to all literate PCs, yet it's one of the most
underused. I can't count the number of players that say that they never even bothered with trying it.<p>
 
Monsters that can't see in Darkness will allow the PC to pound them to death without retaliation. The
only exception is for monsters that are capable of panic. These monsters will be able to hit the PC when
in a state of panic, but <i>only</i> if they do not have an escape route. For this reason, it's best to
avoid using Darkness in a narrow corridor, because stray monsters can easily cut off the escape path of
a powerful monster that is capable of killing the PC with one hit.<p>
 
No giant can see in Darkness, most humanoids also can't, with the notable exceptions of trolls, orcs,
minotaurs, and dark elves. This is especially important to remember against tough monsters such as ogre
magi (yes even the arena champion kind). Vortices, mimics and several other early-game PC killers are
all helpless in Darkness and vortices aren't even capable of panic.<p>
 
There is a bug in the game that keeps Darkness from working properly on door squares. It is important
to mention that the PC is perfectly safe to use Darkness if the <i>PC</i> is on the door square, but not
if the monster is on the door square.<p>
 
Other monsters that are known to see in Darkness (thanks mike):<p>

All orcs, all dark elves, all minotaurs, all undead, all red dragons, great blue wyrm, stone golem,
stone grue, stone snake, earth elemental, greater earth elemental, living wall, wall beast, diamond golem,
eternium golem, steel golem, steel horror, carrion crawler, chaos brother, WMoPC, master assassin, fire demon,
quickling king, quickling queen, greater claw bug, killer bug, least daemon, lesser daemon, greater daemon, 
jackal demon, black unicorn.<p>

<a name="0ef"></a><h4>0.14.15 Dipping stuff into a potion</h4>
The command to dip something into a potion is '!'. 

The various uses of dipping stuff into a potion are compiled below:<p>
<ul>
<li>holy water: bless items
<li>unholy water: curse items
<li>water: clear scrolls, rust iron items
<li>poison: poison weapons
<li>raw chaos: exchange items, see <a href="adomgb-0-14.html#0e4">0.14.4</a>
<li>blessed exchange: exchange items, see <a href="adomgb-0-14.html#0e5">0.14.5</a>
<li>oil: waterproof items (cursed potions work almost 100%, uncursed about 50%, blessed almost 0%)
<li>cursed oil of rust removal: rust items
<li>uncursed oil of rust removal: remove rust from items
<li>blessed oil of rust removal: rustproof items
<li>booze, mana, boost mana: recharge wands, see <a href="adomgb-0-14.html#0e1">0.14.1</a>
</ul><p>

Other potions used for dipping are usualy wasted. The exception is when an item
containing the essence of Chaos and Corruption is dipped into a potion - then the 
potion is transformed into raw chaos. The other exception is Alchemy.<p>

When dipping a stack of items into a potion, the amount you can dip depends on the 
weight of the item. You can dip:<p> 

<table border=1><caption>Dipping
<tr><th>Weight<th>Stack size
<tr><td>1s    <td>19 
<tr><td>2s    <td>9 
<tr><td>3s    <td>6 
<tr><td>4s    <td>4 
<tr><td>5-6s  <td>3 
<tr><td>7-9s  <td>2 
<tr><td>10+s  <td>1
</table><p> 

You can always only dip 1 potion of -stat- or 1 potion of gain attributes. 
You can dip missile ammo in stacks of 40.<p>

<a name="0eg"></a><h4>0.14.16 Rumors</h4>

<li>They say that white dragons suffer from a bad cold. - They are vulnerable to fire and grant cold resistance when eaten.
<li>They say ye cannot shoot yourself, no matter how hard ye try. - The PC cannot shoot his doppleganger "self" since they are immune to missiles. The PC can shoot his real self easily, with lightning bolt, death ray, magic missile, wands of ball lightning or wands of far slaying.

<a name="0eh"></a><h4>0.14.17 The final score</h4>
The algorithm presented here is revised to reflect experiments conducted in April, 2008:
<pre>
score = sum of all skill scores / 20 +
    spell memory [the first number] for each known spell / 5 + 50 +
    MIN(piety - 200, 10000000) +
    (level - 1) * 50 +
    experience / ~3.5 +
    (sum of the danger ratings [1-50] of explored levels) * 30 +
    (# identified items * 100) +
    various amounts for having intrinsics (between 200 and 10000 each) +
    ~2000 (retrieving the cute puppy) +
    20000 (making Blup happy) +
    (sum of attribute modifications * 200) +
    (# of successful dwarven quests * 5000) +
    5000 (if member of thieves guild) +
    5000 (if head of thieves guild) +
    1000 (adhering to the principles of the Cat Lord)
    250000 (saving Khelavaster) +
    2000000 (being a paragon of order) +
    MAX(0, 300 - max. hitpoints) * 1000 (only if the game was completed) +
    20000 (no divine interventions and game complete) +
    20000 (champion) +
    -10000 (fallen champion) +
    -(chaos score * 20) (typical about 1000 points score per corruption)
</pre>
This score is doubled if you managed to solve the major goal of the
game. If you managed to solve the game and leave the Drakalor Chain the
following is added to that score:<p>
MAX(0, 80000 - moves) * 1000<p> 
Then the score is once more doubled.<p>

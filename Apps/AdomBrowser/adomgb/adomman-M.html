<a name="M1"></a><h3>The Game</h3>
ADOM is started by typing<p>

                                <tt>adom</tt><p>

at your command prompt.  After some moments the game will start.<p>

After passing the title screen, you will have to choose whether to
start a new game, restore an old game or page through this manual.<p>

The restore option will provide you with a list of available saved
games from which you can restore a game.  Please note that you can't
restore a game when your character died in that game.<p>

If you choose to create a new character, ADOM first of all will
randomly determine your birth date, your star sign and give some
details about the effects of the events surrounding your birth.  Then
you will have to decide whether to choose a specific class and race to
play or whether you want ADOM to choose for you.  In both cases you
will have to determine the gender of your character.  This has some
influence on game play (in ADOM female characters are more agile, male
characters are slightly stronger).  If you allow fate to decide the
details, ADOM will randomly choose the race and profession of your
character, otherwise you will be presented with lists for both from
which you have to choose.<p>

Then you will have to enter a name for the character you are going to play.
The name has no further influence on game play but serves to
individualize your character.  If you just press ENTER instead of
entering a name, the game will christen your character with a default
name, if the variable "Allow_Default_Names"  is set to "true" in
"adom.cfg" or ".adom.cfg" (depending on your operating system).<p>

Next, the background of your character will be described.  The game
will mention your sex and race (in case fate is responsible for your
race) and then detail your life prior to starting your adventure.  Every
character lives through four major phases of development: early
childhood, childhood, youth and young adulthood.  For each phase
certain events are generated.  These events serve to detail your PC
and influence his attributes.  Finally, you will get to know your
class, your area of specialization (if available) and your starting
age.<p>

After all this you will be dumped directly into the game.  You are
assumed to have just entered one of the major valleys in the Drakalor
Chain and from that point on everything is based on your actions.<p>

<a name="M2"></a><h3>The Main Screen</h3>
Most of the time you will see the main game screen, which contains
most of the interesting information about your character, your
surroundings and your condition.<p>

The following sample shows how a game screen might look:<p>

The first two lines of the screens are reserved for messages which
explain certain events and actions.  If more text is issued than fits
into those two lines, a (more) prompt will appear.  To continue you
have to press SPACE (or Z).  If you are expecting many messages in one
turn which you don't want to read, you also can press ENTER.  All
messages will scroll through without waiting for a confirmation.  If
you want to look at one of those messages later, you can still use the
':m' command (see below).<p>

The last three lines contain information about your character in the
following order:<p>

<ul>
<li>Name: Let's guess what this is :-)
<li><tt>St: </tt>The strength score of your character.
<li><tt>Le: </tt>The learning score of your character.
<li><tt>Wi: </tt>The willpower score of your character.
<li><tt>Dx: </tt>The dexterity score of your character.
<li><tt>To: </tt>The toughness score of your character.
<li><tt>Ch: </tt>The charisma score of your character.
<li><tt>Ap: </tt>The appearance score of your character.
<li><tt>Ma: </tt>The mana score of your character.
<li><tt>Pe: </tt>The perception score of your character.
<li><tt>DV: </tt>The defensive value of your character.
<li><tt>PV: </tt>The protection value of your character.
<li><tt>H: </tt>The hit points of your characters.
<li><tt>P: </tt>The magical power of your character.
<li><tt>Exp:</tt> The experience you have to collected up to now and your
  experience level.  The second number stands for the number of
  experience points you already have earned, the first number
  describes your current experience level.
<li><tt>D: </tt>The number of the current dungeon level.
<li><tt>Sp: </tt>The speed rating of your character.  Optionally the number of
  turns that have passed can be displayed in this area.
<li>A sequence of up to two characters describing your alignment (more
about this in the section on alignment).
</ul><p>

All lines between these two screen parts are used to display the map
of the current dungeon level or wilderness area (as far as you have
explored it).  Specific characters are used to represent items,
monsters, locations, and other stuff.<p>

<a name="M3"></a><h3>The Monster Memory</h3>
One of the utilities provided by ADOM is the so-called monster
memory.  This utility helps the player to memorize useful monster
data, like monster DV and PV, average hitpoints, number of attacks,
average damage, and special powers.  The monster memory can be invoked
in two ways: either you 'l'ook around and demand more information upon
looking at a monster or you invoke the '&' command and enter the
name of a specific monster race (e. g. 'goblin' or 'white baby
dragon').  If you have encountered the monster before, you will
receive information based upon your observations.  This can be as
little as the physical description to as much as complete data about
the combat stats and powers of a monster.<p>

It is important to note that the monster memory takes into account the
abilities of your character.  Based upon his Learning score, his
Perception score and some skills, it is more or less likely that the
character will learn something from his observations.  This also means
that your character might mistake powers for something else.  If a
monster resists a fireball due to its innate magic resistance the
character still will believe that the monster is immune to fire (just
to name on example).  Only later experiences will remedy this
observation.<p>

Additionally, the monster memory is not persistent.  Between two games (that
is: from one character to the next) it will get erased.  This is so
(compared to other games, which keep such a memory) because monsters
in ADOM are pretty dynamic.  They have varying levels and can gain
experience like the PC.  This effectively means that a monster can be
very different between two games.  Since observations thus are very
subjective, it would be pretty misleading to keep such data between
two games.  It is my firm belief that the monster memory should
serve to mirror the observations of the actual character and not those
of the player.  If you want to have a hint through, use some sheets of
paper and a pen (or pencil).<p>

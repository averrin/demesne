<h3>Experience and Advancement</h3>
Each PC in ADOM is rated by his experience level.  A character
starts at level 1 (a newly created adventurer) and might be able to
advance to higher levels by collecting experience points.  Experience
points are mostly gained by killing monsters, but there might be other
ways to learn... try to find out for yourself.<p>

To advance to a higher level, you have to collect a certain number of
experience points.  How many points you have to collect for your next
level is determined by the following categories: race, class, and
attributes.  Generally, you need more experience points to advance if
you are very good in one or more of these categories, you need
less experience points to advance if you are below average in one or
more of those categories.<p>

Whenever you have earned a certain amount of experience points, you
increase in level.  Increasing in levels is a very good thing to do
because this brings many benefits.  Whenever you go up a level, you
get better in combat, receive more hit points and more magical power
(depending on your class and race).  You are also allowed to increase
your skill values.  The number of skill improvements depends on your
learning score.  Finally, you get a chance to raise (or lower) your
attributes.  This decision is made by the game and is heavily
influenced by your class, your experience level and your actions
during game play.  There are finite limits to the number of times you
might be able to increase attribute scores in this way.  Once you have
reached your natural potential, no more training of whatever kind will
help to increase attributes.  Only magical means will further enhance
your attribute scores.<p>

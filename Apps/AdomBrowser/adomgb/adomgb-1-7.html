<h3>Places to avoid in the early game</h3>
There are a few locations on the wilderness map that are to be avoided for low level 
PCs. One of the more mundane is the road found in the central part of the wilderness.
Unfortunately, the easy traveling afforded by this road attracts monsters who will try 
to kill new adventurers. It is quite likely that a hostile group of chaos brothers
and sisters will be found on this road, as well as wandering bands of bandits and other 
outlaw types, including assassins, who use poison. Bottom line: avoid the road with a
low level PC. Travel through the plains and forest areas instead.<p>

As far as truly deadly areas go, the entrance to Darkforge is one (section <a href="adomgb-2-18.html">2.18</a>).
It is found in the central part of the map near the southern border. Darkforge itself is the second level
of this particular dungeon. The danger level of the top level is not that high, but
the down staircase is guarded by a steel golem. These are very tough monsters for a
low level PC to defeat. A low level wizard who has trained the Lightning Bolt spell
may have a chance but is asking for trouble. Another wilderness location that will kill
low level PCs very quickly is the Tower of Eternal Flames. Without good fire resistance
and other special equipment, both the PC and his inventory will be incinerated. See
section <a href="adomgb-2-19.html">2.19</a> for more on the Tower of Eternal Flames. 
Shyssiryxius' cave is difficult
for low level PCs due to the need for water breathing or high hitpoints and on-demand 
teleportation, as well as the presence of nasty aquatic beasts such as dragon turtles
(section <a href="adomgb-2-13.html">2.13</a>).
Some locations, such as the Rift (<a href="adomgb-2-22.html">2.22</a>) and the Minotaur Maze
(<a href="adomgb-2-20.html">2.20</a>), do not allow low level PCs to enter.<p>

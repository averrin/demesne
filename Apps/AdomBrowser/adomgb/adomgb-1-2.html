<h3>Terinyo</h3>
<A HREF="adomgb-1-2-pic.html" target="blank">Click here</A> for a color map of Terinyo.<p>
<a name="121"></a><h4>1.2.1 Tywat Pare</h4>
Tywat Pare is the sheriff in Terinyo. He is the source of two quests. The first
is to find and kill Kranach, a raider lord terrorizing the countryside. The rewards
for this quest are a lawful boost to alignment and 3000 gold pieces. Note that the
lawful boost is greater if a magnanimous PC leaves the 3000 gold pieces on the ground 
where Tywat Pare drops them.<p>

The second quest is available once the PC reaches experience level ten. The quest
objective is to kill the crime lord Hotzenplotz, who can be found in the outlaw 
village Lawenilothehl near Terinyo. Note that attacking Hotzenplotz while he is
nonhostile is a chaotic act. However, the lawful boost received when Tywat Pare is
informed of the success of the mission more than offsets this. As a reward for this
quest Tywat Pare will give the PC a blessed amulet of order, an extraordinarily useful 
item. If the PC has done *both* the Kranach quest and the Hotzenplotz quest, Tywat
Pare will also teach the PC the Law skill after completing the Hotzenplotz quest.<p>

An amulet of order is also available from Tywat Pare if a lawful PC lures him to a 
location where outlaw types can be found. Lawenilothehl is good for this, but a
random wilderness encounter with bandits or raiders will also work. Tywat Pare says
"Let's slay some evil bandits!" and the game generates the message "He hands you a 
deputy's badge." The badge is in fact an amulet of order, which ordinarily seems to
be uncursed. Cursed or blessed amulets are possible.<p>

Tywat Pare will also pay a bounty for the corpse of the following
outlaw types. There is also an alignment boost of bounty / 2.<p>
<ul>
<li>cutpurse: 5
<li>mugger: 50
<li>outlaw: 75
<li>bandit: 75
<li>raider: 100
<li>outlaw leader: 100
<li>assasin: 100
<li>raider lord: 300
<li>master assasin: 500
<li>black druid: 1000 (giving this corpse to druid is preferable)
</ul><p>

<a name="1211"></a><h4>1.2.1.1 Kranach </h4>
Kranach and his gang can be found in the wilderness around Terinyo. Finding him is
a matter of chance and thus can require considerable game time (and therefore food).
There is an experience point limit for this quest. In general, Kranach flees the
Drakalor Chain if the PC reaches experience level six. The exception is Trolls, who
require more experience to advance in level. The exact limit is 5 000 xp. Note the 
experience level six disqualification
especially in the case of Mindcrafters, who are very weak in melee in the early game.
They do not gain a true offensive Mindcraft ability until they reach experience level 
six. Therefore it is very desirable to engage Kranach and his gang with a Mindcrafter
that is just about to achieve experience level six. Ideally, the first or second kill
after finding Kranach should raise the Mindcrafter PC to experience level six.
Note that if your companion kills Kranach, you will fail the quest. <p>

If Kranach leaves a corpse be sure to collect it and attempt to get it back to Tywat 
Pare in Terinyo. When given the corpse, he pays a bounty of 300 gold pieces and 
remarks "We'll put up his head in some public location." Later, on entering Munxip's 
food store, the PC receives the message "A mummified skull hangs over the door of this 
shop."<p>

<a name="122"></a><h4>1.2.2 Rynt</h4>
Rynt is the village elder in Terinyo. He provides a quest, which is mutually
exclusive with Guth'Alak's quest. The quest is to find the village carpenter Yrrigs
who has disappeared in a nearby dungeon (which does not appear unless the quest has 
been assigned). The reward for this quest is lower prices in Munxip's food store
and some directions on how to proceed with the game. Depending on exactly how the
quest is completed, there are additional rewards available - see the next section.<p>

Rynt is also a source of alignment boost when given healing items or stethoscope: <p>
<ul>
<li>potion of healing: 50
<li>potion of cure poison: 100
<li>potion of extra healing: 150
<li>potion of ultra healing: 250
<li>stethoscope: 250
</ul><p>

<a name="1221"></a><h4>1.2.2.1 The Village Dungeon, Jharod and Yrrigs</h4>
The Village Dungeon is where Yrrigs can be found, after receiving the quest from Rynt.
It is southeast of Terinyo. It consists of seven levels. Two important NPCs are
found in the Village Dungeon. The first is Jharod, the healer, found on VD:4. He
will heal PCs of any alignment up to seven times. This can be vital for those PCs
without the Healing skill. He will also cure sickness and poisoning. Jharod will teach 
non-chaotic PCs the Healing skill, or provide a blessed stethoscope 
and increase the knowledge of the skill for those PCs that already have it, or potion of ultra 
healing if Healing skill is already at 100 - providing the PC is able to prove his ability to 
show "mercy."<p>

This can be done in two ways. The first is healing wounded monsters with any healing spell or
potions of healing. The wounded monster must not have been damaged by the PC. A pet can wound
the monster. The second involves Yrrigs the carpenter, who has become insane due to his lengthy
stay in the dungeon. Yrrigs can be found on the last level of the dungeon, level seven. He will
be a purple 't' and will be hostile. He is moderately dangerous. Despite his purple color, Yrrigs
does not have a corrupting melee attack, nor does using Mindcraft against him corrupt a Mindcrafter.
Ideally he should be led to Jharod, who will heal him. Yrrigs recovers from his illness and leaves
a Manual of Bridge Building, a hatchet and a cursed oil of rust removal as rewards. While leading
Yrrigs to Jharod, the PC should use tactics that are as defensive as possible. This means using the
'Coward' setting and possibly dual-wielding shields. Problems arise when the PC encounters other
monsters that must be fought on the way back to Jharod, of course. It is possible to complete Rynt's
quest by killing Yrrigs. In this case Yrrigs drops his items immediately, but the PC must demonstrate
mercy in another way in order to receive the Healing skill from Jharod, and Rynt does not lower the
prices in Munxip's shop. After saving Yrrigs, he can be found in Terinyo and can further train the
Bridge Building skill. Note that it is possible for a chaotic PC to lead Yrrigs to Jharod, change
alignment at a later time and still receive the Healing skill from him. Similarly, it is possible
for a PC to heal a monster earlier in the game in which case Jharod will grant the Healing skill
upon meeting the PC.<p>

The PC will receive lawful boosts during this quest, once for luring Yrrigs to Jharod 
and once for reporting back to Rynt.<p>

<a name="123"></a><h4>1.2.3 Guth'Alak</h4>
Guth'Alak is a druid found in Terinyo. He provides two quests. The first is to find
and kill an evil chaotic druid, Keethrax, who is found in a dungeon southeast of 
Terinyo. Note that this quest and Rynt's are mutually exclusive. There are two sets
of rewards for this quest, chosen by the PC. The PC may choose between "knowledge"
and "power." Choosing power results in gifts of a wand of cold and a spellbook of
Frost Bolt. Choosing knowledge results in Guth'Alak teaching the PC the Herbalism
skill, or Gardening, if the PC already has Herbalism at 100. Guth'Alak provides different
rewards to Druids who complete this quest: amulet of balance, ring of minor elemental
mastery, and bracers of toughness [+0,+0] {To+4}. The exact status of these three items varies.<p>

Guth'Alak's second quest is available only after the PC reaches experience level 30.
The quest is to find and help the Greater White Unicorn, Yrruir. This is the only
way to access the unicorn quests, whether the PC chooses to attempt Yrruir's quest 
or Riurry's quest. See <a href="adomgb-2-26.html">2.26</a><p>

Guth'Alak can turn hostile if the PC tries to chop trees in Terinyo. Even in his hostile state,
he never leaves the water area in Terinyo to pursue the PC. He will cast spells that travel
several spaces. He will help the PC fight Munxip if the PC angers Munxip with the right tactics.<p>

Note that Guth-Alak's quests are Neutral. They draw alignment towards N=. If the PC's alignment 
is on the lawful side of N=, these quests are technically a chaotic act.<p>

Guth Alak will also provide potion of corruption for the corpse of the following monsters:<p>
<ul>
<li>Snake From Beyond
<li>Master Summoner
<li>Ancient Stone Beast
<li>Ancient Chaos Wyrm
<li>Greater Black Unicorn
<li>Chaos Archmage
<li>Black Unicorn
<li>Black Druid
<li>Emperor Moloch
<li>Multi-Headed Chaos Dragon
</ul><p>

<a name="1231"></a><h4>1.2.3.1 The Druid Dungeon and Keethrax</h4>
The corrupted evil druid Keethrax is found in the Druid Dungeon southeast of Terinyo.
He is found on the bottom level of this seven level dungeon. As a druid, he maintains
a contingent of hostile animals on the final level. These will include felines (see
section <a href="adomgb-0-9.html#092">0.9.2</a>) and giant slugs (nasty acid breathers, but their corpses are a source 
of acid immunity). He is vulnerable to acid, webs and magic missiles, but little else
in the way of magic. He uses missile weapons and casts spells including Darkness that
make him a formidable enemy for PCs less than experience level ten. Some players
regard him as an out-of-depth opponent and defer this quest until later in the game.
He carries an artifact, the Black Torc, which is a decent missile weapon but 
permanently cursed. It is good fodder for the demented ratling (see section <a href="adomgb-2-5.html#258">2.5.8</a>).
Keethrax always leaves a corpse. Picking up his corpse is a chaotic act, but
Guth'Alak will reward non-chaotic PCs with a potion of cure corruption in exchange 
for returning Keethrax's corpse to him.<p>

The following animals are generated on DD:7: cave bear,
cave fisher,
cave lion,
cave lizard,
cave tiger,
cobra,
dire wolf,
fire beetle,
fire lizard,
giant bat,
giant centipede,
giant frog,
giant lizard,
giant raccoon,
giant rat,
giant slug,
giant spider,
huge bat,
hyena,
jackal,
large snake,
large spider,
rabid dog,
rat,  
rattlesnake,
silver wolf,
tarantula,
viper,
wild cat,
wolf.<p>

<a name="124"></a><h4>1.2.4 The tiny girl</h4>
The tiny girl is the source of a quest. The objective is to rescue her puppy from a
dungeon northeast of Terinyo. The reward for the quest is a lawful boost and a piece
of candy from the tiny girl. Note that
this quest is difficult and entirely optional. See the next section for more details.<p>

<a name="1241"></a><h4>1.2.4.1 The Puppy Cave</h4>
The puppy dungeon is six levels deep; the puppy is on the last level. The last level
must be entered before four days of game time have elapsed, otherwise the puppy is 
generated as a corpse, presumably dying from starvation. 
The corpse can still be given to the tiny girl for a slight lawful boost, or you can just 
tell girl it died for the same result, even without corpse in inventory. The cute dog corpse will not rot, 
however eating it will both curse and doom, so should be done only in an emergency if at all.
Incidentally, there is a way to fulfill the quest even if the cute dog dies. Instead of telling 
the tiny girl about its death, one can wish for a cute dog and and deliver the wished-for cute 
dog to her. She won't know the difference. Whether you would want to spend a wish in this manner 
is another matter.<p>  
There are some guaranteed
features in the dungeon. The first is a hive of giant ants, always found on the
second level. These are very difficult to kill for a low level PC and ideally should
be avoided completely. The second is an open cavernous level on the fifth level with
a high monster generation rate that is characteristic of these open levels. Finally,
there is a lesser vault on the last level of the dungeon. The puppy generally can be
found without fighting through the vault; this is the best course of action. The puppy
will be tame if found alive and will follow the PC out of the dungeon. Take care,
however, since the puppy will fight the PC's enemies on the way out, even enemies that 
are too difficult for it to kill. The general approach on this quest should be to get
to the bottom of the dungeon, carefully find the puppy and get out as fast as possible 
with a minimum of fighting. Note also that if the puppy is generated dead, retrieving
the corpse and returning it to the tiny girl still provides some lawful boost.
Furthermore this means that the quest can be done *at any time* after the PC has 
gained experience thus having a better chance of surviving the dungeon. It is
worthwhile to do this quest even if the time limit has passed, since shops, altars, 
herbs and pools can be generated in this dungeon. Hives containing bees are common but
not guaranteed.<p>

<a name="125"></a><h4>1.2.5 Blup</h4>
Blup is a baby water dragon. He asks the PC to find his mother. He will also teach
the Swimming skill if given potions of carrot juice. Blessed potions are more
effective as one would expect. His mother can be found in an underwater cave in the
large lake west of Terinyo. This is not something low level PCs should attempt. It
requires the ability to breathe water, or *very* careful planning. There are also
very dangerous monsters found in the underwater cave. More information on this is
found in section <a href="adomgb-2-13.html">2.13</a>. Blup enjoys candy more than
children do (+10 alignment for giving candy to Blup, +2 for children).<p>

<a name="126"><h4>1.2.6 Munxip</h4>
Munxip is the shopkeeper in Terinyo. His is a specialty shop, selling food only.
5/6 of items in Munxip's shops are large rations.
Like all shopkeepers, he is *tough*. It is best for low level PCs to buy from his
shop without attempting anything dishonest. It is possible for PCs with low Strength
to simply pick up, without paying for, enough large rations to train Strength if the
PC runs around in his shop long enough. Munxip will block the door so the PC will not
be interrupted. Just do not attempt to leave without paying. ;-)<p>

<a name="127"></a><h4>1.2.7 Yggaz</h4>
Yggaz is the village fool in Terinyo. He is a source of rumors (see section 
<a href="adomgb-0-14.html#0eg2">0.14.16.2</a>) and will trade random 
potions for potions of booze.<p>

<a name="128"></a><h4>1.2.8 Townspeople</h4>
Farmers are found in Terinyo. A farmer corpse is a quest object for Gaab'Baay
(see section <a href="adomgb-2-21.html#2l6">2.21.6</a>). Farmers will also provide rations and
+10 alignment for tools, such as a scythe, and will accept seeds for a small lawfull boost.
The remaining townspeople are simply flavor elements without any real importance
in the game. They can be used as cannon fodder, of course. Lure them out of town to kill them for
experience. Train Ventriloquism on them and they can then be slaughtered right in town without consequence.
Confusion Blast works similarly. If a C alignment is desired (for robbing Munxip without cursing,
for example), anything goes.<p>

<a name="129"></a><h4>1.2.9 Magical island</h4>
The magical island is a single tile surrounded by water in the center of Terinyo. 
Staying on the island guarantees PP regeneration every turn.<p>

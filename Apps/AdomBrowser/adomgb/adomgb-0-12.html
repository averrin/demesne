<a name="0c"></a><h3>Intrinsics</h3>
<a name="0c1"></a><h4>0.12.1 Resistances</h4>
There are various resistances available. These are:<p>
<ul>
<li>Damage types: fire, cold, acid, shock
<li>Special attacks: paralysis, petrification, poison, confusion, death rays,
 sleep, stun, sick
</ul><p>

Remember that resistance does NOT equal immunity in ADOM, i.e. being hit by a
death ray while resistant will not kill you instantly, but will still deal a
significant amount of damage.
Some of the resistances can be gained by eating an appropriate monster corpse:
Intrinsic fire resistance can be gained by eating the corpse of fire-related creatures. 
The game generates messages related to this:<p>

<ul>
<li>Fire beetle (50% chance of gaining fire resistance):
You suddenly feel very hot! (whether or not resistance has actually been granted)
<li>Fire lizard (10% chance of gaining fire resistance):
You suddenly shiver. (fire resistance granted)
This stuff cools you down! (fire resistance not granted)
<li>Larger fire creatures, fire drakes, red dragons, and red wyrms, grants fire resistance
every time.<p>
</ul><p>

There are further considerations about fire resistance in the Tower of Eternal Flames. 
See section <a href="adomgb-2-19.html">2.19</a> for more explanation.<p>
<ul>
<li>Cold resistance can be gained by eating white dragons or white wyrms corpses.
<li>Acid resistance can be gained by eating ankheg, ant, black dragon or black wyrm corpses.
<li>Shock resistance can be gained by eating lightning lizard, blue dragons or blue wyrms corpses.
<li>Poison resistance can be gained by eating giant centipede, cave fisher, tarantula, snake, viper, 
spider, or dark elven corpses. Be aware that most of this both poisons the PC and grants 
resistance, so the PC will have to endure a brief period of poisoning.
<li>Petrification resistance can be gained by eating gorgon corpse (but the PC should have it already
by other means, else is risking death)
</ul><p>

An interesting test conducted by Petri Sihvola regarding petrification by a gorgon's breath:<p>
<pre>
> I did some testing and there's an approximate 50% chance of dying 
> to a gorgon breath without resistance. However, if DV is high enough 
> the chance is drastically reduced. This one shows my DV and how many 
> times I died:

> DV:23 10/20
> DV:44 8/20
> DV:53 1/20
> DV:69 0/20
</pre><p>

</table><p>

[1] final sickness attack deals 6d6 damage. It can be prevented with resistance, or (Wi*3.45)% chance or (Healing/5)% chance.<p>

<a name="0c2"></a><h4>0.12.2 Immunities</h4>
Immunity to the four basic damage types is possible: fire, cold, acid and shock.
Immunity means that the PC will take no damage from the corresponding elemental 
attack. However, creatures which deal elemental damage can still harm the PC, due 
to their ability to deal physical damage. The PC is only immune to damage from 
the elemental attack.<p>

Obtaining immunities:<p>
<ul>
<li>Crowning
	<ul>
		<li>grants an immunity to one of fire, cold, acid or shock.
	</ul>
<li>Wearables
	<ul>

			<ul>
				<li>red - fire
				<li>white - cold
				<li>blue - shock
				<li>black - acid

	</ul>
</ul><p>

<a name="0c3"></a><h4>0.12.3 Dooming and Cursing</h4>
Basically, Cursed and Doomed intrinsics decrease PC's Luck, which is a 
hidden property. See section <a href="adomgb-0-6.html#064">0.6.4</a> for 
details.<p>

Dooming or Cursing, as might be expected from the names, is generally 
to be avoided. They result from committing acts that are very contrary 
to the PCs alignment. For example, robbing shops with a lawful PC may 
cause both cursing and dooming. Robbing a shop with a neutral PC may 
cause only cursing. Robbing a shop with a neutral PC and killing the 
shopkeeper on the way out will quite likely cause both dooming and 
cursing. They are also quite commonly obtained by drinking from pools,
or eating certain corpses (ancient dwarf, dwarven child, annis hag, 
green hag, priest, quasit, royal guardian, cat lord, 
demons, cute dog, (greater) white unicorn, oracle).
Cursing makes the game nudge all the die-rolls against the PC, generate
more monsters which hit harder while the PC's hits become weaker. 
Dooming is a more severe form of this. Dooming also increases food 
consumption, makes traps more difficult to avoid and makes it much more
difficult to pray for divine help.<p>

Nevertheless, there are ways to exploit these intrinsics. These 
techniques are not for the beginner, of course. Since monsters become 
tougher, they are worth more experience and carry better items. Vaults 
become more common. If the PC wants to achieve Grand Mastery in a weapon 
class, becoming Cursed and/or Doomed in the wilderness is the only way to 
do it in a reasonable time frame.<p> 

Dooming and cursing can be removed by sacrificing at a coaligned altar. 
It may take considerable sacrificing to remove the Cursed/Doomed 
intrinsics, since they are only removed at the "very close" level of 
piety. Praying while the PC is already at very close status also may 
remove dooming and/or cursing, although these intrinsics make it more 
difficult to appeal for divine assistance, as noted above. Removing Dooming 
(only) results in the message "You feel a terrible gloom being lifted from 
you." Removing Cursing (only) results in the message "You feel relieved." 
Removing both Cursing and Dooming simultaneously results in only the "You 
feel a terrible gloom being lifted from you." message.<p>

Another trick for exploiting the Doomed state is as follows: If a PC finds 
an altar early in the game, ideally before the Si level so that zero or 
very few artifacts have been generated, the PC should purchase or acquire
plenty of food (cooked lizards and/or stomafillia herbs), become Doomed by 
eating a Dooming corpse (daemons and quasits spring to mind) or wearing a 
ring of Doom, and then exploit the heavy monster generation by sacrificing 
the monsters on the altar. This can quickly lead to very close or even 
extremely close status. After the Dooming is removed, by removing a cursed 
ring of doom or through reaching very close status, the PC can be crowned 
or precrowned.<p>

Dooming also has an effect in dark rooms: if a Doomed PC wanders into 
a dark room, there is 2% chance for an instakill every turn 
"You are likely to be eaten by a grue." (this only applies to Doomed 
characters). Deliberately playing in a Cursed or Doomed state is dangerous
and should be reserved for those players who know exactly why they are doing it.<p>

There is a game bug that causes fireproof blankets to be positively affected by
 the Cursed and Doomed intrinsics. It makes them last almost forever in the ToEF.
 It is probably not worth the cursing or dooming to make the blanket last. The 
ToEF is usually difficult enough in a Blessed state.<p>

The following items grant cursing only: Black Torc, Executor. <p>
The following items grant dooming only: armor/weapon/missile of damnation,
javelin of doom, Celestrix.<p>
The following items grant both cursing and dooming: crown of science, Crown of Chaos,
Medal of Chaos, ring of doom, boots of great speed, Sceptre of Chaos.<p>

<a name="0c4"></a><h4>0.12.4 Lucky and Fate smiles</h4>
Basically, Lucky and Fate smiles intrinsics increases PC's Luck, which is a 
hidden property. See section <a href="adomgb-0-6.html#064">0.6.4</a> for 
details.<p>

The Lucky and Fate smiles intrinsics are the good counterparts to the
Cursing and Dooming intrinsics, respectively. They cause the game to 
nudge die-rolls in the PC's favor. The effect is not as dramatic as 
the Dooming and Cursing intrinsics. It should be noted that all four 
intrinsics may be present simultaneously. The negative ones are 
considerably stronger.<p>

The Lucky and Fate smiles intrinsics are naturally gained by PCs as
they sacrifice on coaligned altars; the messages are:<p>

"You feel an inner strength lifting your spirits!" - The Lucky intrinsic<br>
"You feel very close to -deity-." - The Fate smiles intrinsic<p>

Eating karmic corpses increases Luck, by losing Dooming, Cursing, or gaining 
Lucky or Fate smiles intrinsics.<p>

The following items grant Lucky intrinsic only: amulet/ring of luck, Preserver,
bracers of war, Purifier.<p>

The following items grant Fate smiles intrinsic only: Ring of the Master Cat.<p>

The following items grant both Lucky and Fate smiles intrinsic: ankh, True
Strength.<p>

<a name="0c5"></a><h4>0.12.5 Teleportitis and Teleport Control</h4>
Teleportitis is a "disease" that causes your PC to teleport around randomly. 
It is obtainable from pools (you feel jumpy), corruption (your close 
attunement to corrupted astral space allows teleportation), from eating 
the right corpse (pixie) and items (helm of teleportation, cloak of Oman). 
It can be useful for escaping tight spots such as being surrounded by monsters 
(though it never seems to kick in when needed ;), for shoplifting and for 
reaching areas that are usually inaccessible.<p>

Teleport Control allows you to choose the destination when teleporting your PC. 
It works whether the cause of the teleportation is teleportitis or deliberate, 
such as zapping a wand of teleportation or casting the Teleport spell at the PC's 
current location. Mindcrafters always get teleport control at experience level 
one, others have to rely on eating the right corpse (blink dog), drinking from 
pools (you feel like jumping around) or wearing items (amulet/ring of teleport
control, boots of the Divine Messenger).<p>

Controlled teleportation is important in the game. There is a guaranteed wand of 
teleportation in the VDDL level of the Assassin's Guild. It can be found using 
any of the item detection techniques. The wand and potions of booze are then 
on-demand teleportation. Teleport control is not guaranteed but if necessary, 
the PC can stair hop in the Infinite Dungeon between I3 and I4 until blink 
dogs are generated.<p>

The following locations disallow teleportation of any source:<p>
<ul>
    <li> Any elemental temple. This does not include the lower levels of the Tower of Eternal Flames.
    <li> The last level of the Tomb of the High Kings (the actual tomb containing the piranha lake and the ring) (<a href="adomgb-2-12.html">2.12</a>)
    <li> BUGCAV (The underground level of the Bug Temple) (<a href="adomgb-2-27.html">2.27</a>)
    <li> The cat lord level (<a href="adomgb-3-6.html">3.6</a>)
    <li> The final level of the Assassins Guild (<a href="adomgb-2-11.html#2b3">2.11.3</a>)
    <li> D:49 (<a href="adomgb-3-12.html">3.12</a>)
</ul><p> 

<a name="0c6"></a><h4>0.12.6 Invisibility and See Invisible</h4>
Invisibility provides several bonuses to Stealth, Backstabbing, to hit/damage etc. 
Be aware however that invisible PC's are not allowed to fight in the Arena. Invisibility
can be gained by drinking from pools (you suddenly are gone), eating 
invisible stalker corpse (10% chance), or wearing items, such as ring/robe/cloak 
of invisibility, or Branalbin Cloak of Defence. Being invisible by wearing items 
severely increases food consumption, see section 
<a href="adomgb-0-3.html#032">0.3.2</a> for details. Potions of invisibility/visibility
and the Invisibility spell provide temporary effect.<p>

The See Invisible intrinsic can be gained by drinking from pools (your eyes tingle), eating
invisible stalker corpse (90% chance), wearing a ring of see invisible, Amulet of Raw
Steel, Medal of Chaos, Ring of the Master Cat, Crown of Leadership, Ancient Mummy
Wrapping, Shirt of The Saints, or wielding rune-covered trident or Trident of The Red
Rooster.<p>

<a name="0c7"></a><h4>0.12.7 Water breathing</h4>
It is possible to gain the water breathing intrinsic by eating 
Blup's or Shyssiryxius' corpse. The message "For some seconds 
a strange liquid seems to fill your lungs." is generated.<p>

Elementalists receive water breathing as an intrinsic class power 
at experience level 25. Certain items and wielded weapons grant 
the intrinsic. The most common items are probably the helm of 
water breathing and amulet of water breathing.<p>

Items which grant this ability include:<p>
<ul>
<li>helm/amulet of water breathing
<li>the rune-covered trident - when wielded<br>
<li>the Trident of the Red Rooster - when wielded<br>
<li>the Medal of Chaos - when worn
</ul><p>

The following items also stop drowning, although water breathing is not listed 
as an intrinsic at the time.<p>
<ul>
<li>rings of the fish - AUTOCURSING; 1 blessed or 2 of any status stop drowning 
damage, single uncursed ring stops drowning 80%, cursed 60% of the time - if the PC is not cursed or doomed
<li>armor of the sea - stops drowning 100%, 80%, 60% of the time (blessed,
uncursed,cursed)
</ul><p>

Water breathing is the only intrinsic which cannot be gained/lost via drinking 
from pools.<p>

<a name="0c8"></a><h4>0.12.8 Special powers</h4>
<a name="0c81"></a><h4>0.12.8.1 Regeneration</h4>
Regeneration is a special item power which generates one additional hit point per turn. It works in addition to natural
regeneration described in section <a href="adomgb-0-14.html#0e6">0.14.6</a>. The effects are cumulative, so if the PC
has two sourcers of Regeneration, it gains additional 2 HP per turn. The following items grant Regeneration: crown/ring/bracers of regeneration,
bracers of war, Preserver, True Strength, Celestrix, and knife of endurance.
It is possible to regenerate a maximum of 9 HP per turn via Regeneration (head, amulet, girdle, hands, rings, bracers, missile).<p>

<a name="0c82"></a><h4>0.12.8.2 Critical hits</h4>                                                       
Critical hits is a special item power which allows the PC to score critical hits more often. 
If a Critical hit is scored, the attack message generated includes "with full force" phrase. In case of missile attack, 
the message includes "exactly hit" phrase. As critical hits do not bypass PV, it is possible to receive the "You hit the 
-monster- with full force and fail to hurt it." message. In such a case even the double amount of damage wasn't enough 
to get past the PV. Consider switching the form of offense. 
The following items grant Critical hits:
bracers of war, Ring of the Master Cat, orcish dagger, whip of slaughtering, Grod, Serpent's Bite, axe of the minotaur
emperor, spear of raw steel, and murderous weapon. Refer to section <a href="adomgb-0-7.html#077">0.7.7</a> for more quantitative 
details.<p>

<a name="0c83"></a><h4>0.12.8.3 Autocursing</h4>
Autocursing items become cursed when equipped. It is obviously a bad effect, though not terrible for moderately advanced PC, since the curse can be removed via
regular means, which include dipping the item into potion of holy water, reading a scroll of uncursing, casting the Remove Curse spell, praying, or using 
Wizard's 40th level
class power. The following mostly bad items share the AUTOCURSING property: amulet of hunger, ring of doom, ring of the fish, ring of weakness, gauntlets of peace,
boots of the slow shuffle, Black Torc, Medal of Chaos, crown of science, Shezestriakis, auto-locking armor, Moon Sickle, and Kinslayer.<p>

<a name="0c84"></a><h4>0.12.8.4 Slaying</h4>
Many artifact and few special regular weapons are imbued with Slaying powers. This means the particular weapon always scores a critical hit against certain monster types.
Vanquisher is very valued artifact weapon since it slays almost everything. A missile of slaying (without specification) slays everything. Use the representing letter and common sense
to determine monster types. If you need to know exactly which monster belongs to which monster types, search
<a href="adomgb-app-P.html">Appendix P</a> for a site containing monsters data dump.<p>

<a name="0c841"></a><table border="1"><caption>Slaying weapons</caption>
<tr><th>Monster type<th>Weapons
<tr><td>Battle bunnies <td>rabbit knife
<tr><td>Constructs <td>Vanquisher, Purifier, arrow/quarrel of construct slaying
<tr><td>Demons <td>Vanquisher, Grod, rune-covered trident, Purifier, Executor, Trident of the Red Rooster, Justifier, arrow/quarrel/sling bullet of demon slaying
<tr><td>Dragons <td>Vanquisher, Wyrmlance, arrow/quarrel of dragon slaying
<tr><td>Giants <td>Vanquisher, Grod, arrow/quarrel of giant slaying
<tr><td>Humanoids <td>Vanquisher, Serpent's Bite, Skullcrusher, Executor, Kinslayer, arrow/quarrel of humanoid slaying
<tr><td>Insects <td>Bugbiter
<tr><td>Jellies <td>Vanquisher, Soaker, arrow/quarrel of jelly slaying
<tr><td>Plants <td>scorched spear, Black Thumb
<tr><td>Undead <td>mace of disruption, Vanquisher, rune-covered trident, Purifier, Trident of the Red Rooster, Justifier, Sun's Messenger, arrow/quarrel of undead slaying, Black Torc
</table><p>

<a name="0c85"></a><h4>0.12.8.5 Returning</h4>
Some missiles or weapons possess a special Returning power, which means the missile or weapon returns when thrown. This does not mean the PC catches it automatically -
the actual chance of successfully catching a returning missile depends on Dexterity and Luck. The following missiles and artifacts share the Returning power:
dagger/spear/drakish scurgar of returning, curved throwing club, javelin of doom, boomerang, Black Torc, Rolf's Companion, rune-covered trident,
Trident of the Red Rooster, hammer of the gods, and spear of raw steel.<p>

<a name="0c86"></a><h4>0.12.8.6 Penetration</h4>
Penetration is the act of bypassing the PV of a creature in combat, dealing damage as if the creature has PV of 0. For PC, penetration can only be achived via a phase dagger, 
a penetrating weapon, a missile of penetration, or via Archer's 40th level class power, which grants 20% chance of bypassing enemy armor when using missile.
On the other hand, several monsters, such as ratling duelists and claw bugs, will always bypass the PV of the PC.<p>

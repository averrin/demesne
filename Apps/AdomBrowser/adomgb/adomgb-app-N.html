<caption>Differences in ADOM versions</caption>
<tr><th>Version  <th>Notes
<tr><td>0.2.0    <td>first alpha version; only one dungeon; unwinnable
<tr><td>0.4.0    <td> Dwarftown, shops, herbs, pools added; first winnable version
<tr><td>0.7.0    <td> first public release; color added
<tr><td>0.9.0    <td> the game as it appears today comes into existence
                 with a wilderness; ToEF added
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 6  <td> no Mana Temple; chaos god ending was possible;
                 no class powers; no Assassins' Guild; last gamma 
                 where RotHK dungeon was a single level; stat 
                 increases with herbs were unlimited
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 7  <td> suffered from a fatal bug in the Mana Temple,
                 all walls were undiggable, Mindcrafters could 
                 still win by teleporting in with their class 
                 power; class powers introduced
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 8  <td> regarded as a very easy version; several new
                 artifacts; last gamma where drakelings became 
                 permanently fast from heat
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 9  <td> very difficult version: less item generation,
                 more item destruction, first version where dropped 
                 items were destroyed by ranged spells, elemental 
                 orbs corrupted merely by carrying; Necromancer 
                 display bug when creating slaves; first yellow 
                 pyramid and color-changing top level of ToEF
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 10 <td> extensively pretested which made this quite stable
                 and balanced; first version where TotRR was 
                 available; vortices introduced; crumpled scroll, 
                 emperor moloch and quickling bard could be wished 
                 for; first implementation of wand of destruction 
                 ending; ultra endings were not possible because of 
                 requirement to wield both Sceptre and Trident at 
                 gate entry - Trident is two-handed!; game would 
                 sometimes crash unrecoverably upon entering the ID 
                 level containing Filk
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 11 <td> firing autotargeted missiles without selecting a
                 target crashed the game
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 12 <td> stable; suffered from annoying bug that made many
                 +0 items possible; last gamma where the & symbol 
                 was used for necklaces
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 13 <td> piety loss (much too high) and preferred sacrifices
                 introduced; equipment destruction was ridiculous in 
                 this gamma; rivers introduced; room effects 
                 introduced; new room connection algorithm made some 
                 levels unplayable; short-lived
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 14 <td> piety loss still too high; room connection
                 algorithm fixed
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 15 <td> first attempt at monster inventories: monsters
                 which picked up items would not necessarily 
                 drop them when killed - including artifacts 
                 like the Chaos Orbs; +0 bug since gamma 12 
                 solved; piety loss toned down again
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 16 - prerelease 1 <td> no entering dungeons?
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 16 - prerelease 2 <td> bugs include a duplicate artifact
                 bug and a strange (integer overflow?) bug that 
                 causes weird items (most often daggers with 
                 outrageous stats that cannot be picked up) and 
                 monsters that deal thousands of points of damage 
                 in a single hit - a very rare bug that does not 
                 make the game unplayable; there is also a duplicating 
                 missiles bug
<tr><td>1.0.0    <td>released to the public August 6th, 2001; added item
                 prefixes and suffixes; added a new wilderness location, 
                 the Bug Infested Temple; removed possibility of 
                 teleportation in elemental temples
<tr><td>1.1.0    <td>released to the public November 10th, 2002; talent system
                 added; preliminary results indicate this is a very buggy release
<tr><td>1.1.1    <td>released to the public November 20th, 2002; bug fix for 1.1.0; bugs encountered so far:
                 signal 291; extended drop can crash the game; "no mortal monster" bug; other problems: 
                 monsters gain experience too quickly, jackals are a prime example

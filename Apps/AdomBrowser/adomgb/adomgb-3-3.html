<h3>The Casino</h3>
The Casino is found on D: 30 or D: 31. The layout is as follows:<p>

The guaranteed monsters found here are casino guards (the @s outside the 
Great Gift Shoppe), a big casino guard (guarding the down staircase) and 
the shopkeeper (the @ inside the Great Gift Shoppe). The $s in the body
of the Casino are not piles of gold, but rather slot machines. There
will be a number of non-hostile monsters wandering about the Casino and 
the Great Gift Shoppe.<p>

It is possible to win essentially unlimited amounts of gold from the slot 
machines. Intrinsic Dooming, Cursing, Lucky and Fate Smiles have no effect.
Wearing items that grant Luck (the hidden property) or the Lucky/Fate Smiles 
intrinsics make no difference. The fastest way to accumulate money is to
choose a machine that costs 24 gold pieces to play and 'h'andle the lever.  
Place a heavy object on the spacebar of your keyboard. Check back after five
minutes or so by picking up the gold on the floor. There should be quite a
pile.<p>

As long as the technique above is used - simply leaving the spacebar 
depressed - all of this gambling will take place during a single game 
turn, so the PC will not be spending hours of game time in the Casino 
getting corrupted. This is after all D: 30 or D: 31, moderately deep in the 
CoC. So resist the temptation to check on your winnings every 30 seconds! ;-)<p>

A possible side effect of long gambling sessions is stunning. Ideally wear a
source of stun resistance or have the intrinsic. Alternatively, prayer will
remove stunning. Despite the fact that only a single game turn passes, it is
also possible to become Very Hungry (but not Starving). Have food.<p>

This implies, of course, that it is possible to buy everything in the Great Gift
Shoppe. But how to carry it? Since there is an unlimited amount of gold available,
a (blessed!) girdle of greed can solve that problem. The Big Casino Guard will often
allow a net winner passage if he simply goes to a slot machine and loses one round.
Try more than once if necessary.<p>

The payout from the slot machines follows a precise formula, shown below:<p>

<a name="331"></a><table border=1><caption>3.3.1 Casino winnings</caption>
<tr><th>Item    <th>           Two alike    <th>    Three alike

<tr><Td>magical ring     <td>     144x       <td>       1728x
<tr><Td>magical weapon   <td>     169x       <td>       2197x
<tr><Td>magical armor    <td>     196x       <td>       2744x
<tr><Td>artifact         <td>     225x       <td>       3375x
<tr><Td>ancient hero     <td>     256x       <td>       4096x
<tr><Td>dragon           <td>     289x       <td>       4913x
<tr><Td>ancient dragon   <td>     324x       <td>       5832x
</table><p>

As an example, two goblins results in a return of 4x the original bet, 
for a profit of 3x the original bet. The average payout works out to
approximately 24x the original bet. This has been verified empirically,
and agrees with theory.<p>

Be aware that if the PC uses the slot machines, the Big Casino Guard will 
block the down staircase and expect the PC to spend his winnings - and 
more - in the Great Gift Shoppe, which is ridiculously overpriced. This
problem can be solved by teleporting the Big Casino Guard. This transports
him to another location on the level. He does not become hostile, does not
move and behaves exactly as if he were still blocking the stairs (this is 
probably a bug).<p>

<a name="332"></a><h4>3.3.2 Strategies for robbing the Casino</h4>
There are two monsters that are particularly tough on the level: the 
shopkeeper and the big casino guard. Their vital statistics:<p>
Big casino guard:
<pre>
You examine the big casino guard. Diagnosis: Level: 2, DV: 19,
PV: 24, Hits: 307, Attacks: 2, Damage: 17-72. Speed: 106.
</pre>
Shopkeeper:
<pre>
You examine Orgovek, the human shopkeeper. Diagnosis: Level: 11,
DV: 10, PV: 20, Hits: 926, Attacks: 6, Damage: 21-36. Speed: 195.
</pre>

These stats do not change after the monsters become hostile.<p>

It is possible to use Ventriloquism as usual to confuse the Casino shopkeeper.
Remember if the skill is not at 100 he may become hostile in the next turn, so
doing this under cover of Darkness is a wise precaution. A tactic that accomplishes
the same result (no cursing, no alerting the guards) is to zap a wand of far slaying
at him from very far away, 15 squares or more. These are both risky since a hostile
Casino shopkeeper is a formidable opponent. The best sequence of events is to gather
everything the PC wants, anger the shopkeeper and teleport straight to the down
staircase.<p>

There are a number of events that will cause all the monsters to become hostile
whether or not the PC has actually picked up anything from the Great Gift Shoppe.
Directly attacking the guards or shopkeeper or zapping a wand of destruction that
damages any of the guards or the walls of the Great Gift Shoppe are examples.
Once the monsters become hostile, a number of things happen. First, the number of
guards on the level approximately triples. They cluster around both the up and down
staircases and are plentiful elsewhere. Second, the teleportation restrictions inside
the Great Gift Shoppe cease. This means the PC is free to teleport to any location on
the level, but since the up and down staircases will be blocked by guards, it is not
possible to teleport to these locations and leave the level.<p>

Invisibility is strange on the level. The casino guards and the big
casino guard see invisible. The shopkeeper welcomes an invisible PC when
he enters the Great Gift Shoppe, but when an invisible PC picks up an 
item, the shopkeeper does not immediately block the door. The standard
"shopkeeper stares at your position with great intensity" message must be 
generated before he blocks the door. However, the shopkeeper instantly
sounds an alarm when an undetected invisible PC who has picked up an item 
leaves the Great Gift Shoppe. Despite this, the shopkeeper does not see
the invisible PC as he flees through the body of the Casino.<p>

None of the monsters on the level are able to see in darkness. However,
some will still cluster around the PC in darkness, while others, including 
the big casino guard who ordinarily blocks the down staircase, will wander 
aimlessly. This means that if a PC needs to rest and recover hitpoints,
or pray for healing, or drink healing potions, darkness is your friend.  
A PC can stand in one spot indefinitely in the dark. The tendency of the
monsters to cluster around the PC or wander about also means they will 
leave the vicinity of the staircases. Thus a PC can rob the Casino, cast 
Darkness, wait, then teleport to the down staircase. This is risky,
however, since if the PC is doomed by robbing the Casino (see below) there 
is a 1 in 1000 chance of an instadeath each turn from a grue attack (see 
section <a href="adomgb-0-13.html#0d4">0.13.4</a>).<p>

The stats for the shopkeeper above should make it clear that speed is 
critical when robbing the Casino. Anything that increases speed is
valuable - rings of speed, speed boosting potions and especially seven 
league boots. It is possible to make the shopkeeper hostile by throwing
missiles or zapping a spell at him, ideally from as far away as possible, 
then literally outrun him out of the Great Gift Shoppe. This is one
way the Casino can be robbed without any spells whatsoever.<p>

The stats should also make it clear that killing him is worth many experience
points. This is a consideration for those PCs who desperately need experience.<p>

<a name="333"></a><h4>3.3.3 Consequences of robbing the Casino</h4>
The consequences of robbing the Casino vary according to a couple of 
factors. First is the alignment of the PC. Lawful PCs will likely be
cursed and doomed. Neutral PCs will likely be cursed, perhaps doomed.
Chaotics will probably get away with no cursing or dooming. Lawful and
neutral PCs will move their alignment towards chaotic. This may or may
not be visible on the main screen. It is known for PCs to be so lawful
by this point in the game that their alignment does not vary from L+ 
despite robbing the Casino. The second factor is exactly what transpires
during the robbery. Killing the shopkeeper in the process of robbing the
Casino is not recommended for crowned champions of Law or Balance, of 
course. Attacking the guards on the way out or after dragging them down
to the next level should not cause an alignment drop as they will be 
hostile at that point.<p>

The cursing and/or dooming is obviously the biggest problem PCs face 
after robbing the Casino. Fortunately, there is a shortcut to the surface
of the Drakalor Chain (see section <a href="adomgb-3-4.html">3.4</a>)
 available one or two levels below 
the Casino. This makes it possible to get to a coaligned altar near the
surface quickly and sacrifice in order to get rid of the unwanted cursing 
or dooming, although it is possible at this point in the game that the 
player might want to exploit those intrinsics. In any case, remember
where those coaligned altars are near the surface! If you plan to rob
the Casino, they can be essential.<p>

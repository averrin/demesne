[1] It teaches the PC random spell (Light and Wish equally likely), or improves knowledge in a known spell if read successfully, 
and corrupts 20 CP's per turn spent reading, min 200, max 6666. As an artifact, the black tome cannot be destroyed - if a failure 
would destroy it, the next entry in the list is used instead (see <a href="adomgb-0-5.html#0515">0.5.1.5</a> Learning spells mechanics).<p>

[1] Scrolls of defense and protection affect only the following worn items in this order: armor, 
helmet, cloak, boots, gauntlets, girdle, bracers. Cursed SoD and SoP always decrease DV or PV by 
one. Blessed SoD and SoP may increase items with low DV or PV by two or three points.<p>
[2] Raven borns get additional DL+5 and a more powerful ally on top of that<p>

All scrolls weigh 2s. All books and scrolls are made of paper. When used in melee or as a missile, spellbooks do (-4, 1d2) damage,
scrolls are (+0, 1d1).<p>

<a name="05"></a><h3>Spells and Mindcraft - description and usefulness</h3>

<a name="051"></a><h4>0.5.1 Spells</h4>
There is a description of available spells except Wish in the <a href="adomman-J.html#J4">ADOM Manual</a>. The range and
damage information has been removed from the manual in ADOM 1.1.x+. Accordingly 
they are tabulated below.<p>

Wizards, Priests, Druids, and Necromancers are 10 times more likely to find spellbooks. Paladins 2,5 times.<p>

<a name="0511"></a><h4>0.5.1.1 Casting</h4>
Note that spells become more costly to cast (in terms of PP) as the number of 
available castings decreases. Thus a spell will increase in cost as the number 
of available castings decreases below 100 or so, becoming very noticeable as 
the number drops below about 30. This is class dependent but will affect all 
classes to differing extents. Note also that the number of available castings 
is not a simple "decrement by one each time the spell is cast" type of formula. 
Again depending on class, the difficulty of casting the spell and probably other 
factors this will vary. For example, casting Light with 1000 castings available 
to a level 40 Wizard may decrease the available castings by one, while casting
Death Ray with 20 castings available with a level 30 Archer may reduce the
available castings to zero. These are purely hypothetical examples but should 
give an idea of the trends.<p>

<a name="0512"></a><h4>0.5.1.2 Ball spells</h4>
Ball spells are extraordinarily useful since no 
monsters shrug them off. They are wonderful when the PC is surrounded, of course. 
It is worth switching to Coward tactics and waiting to be completely surrounded 
before casting. Since they are relatively costly in terms of PP, it is useful to 
destroy the maximum number of enemies with each casting. Fire magic is 
particularly effective against cold-based creatures and undead including mummies. 
Cold magic is particularly effective against fire-based creatures.
The diameter of ball spells is dependent upon Willpower / 8.
However, this diameter only increases as a multiple of sixteen since ball spells radiate 
symmetrically; the minimum diameter is two. Therefore getting Willpower to 24, 
for instance, does not increase the diameter. Willpower must be increased to 
32 for the diameter to increase to four, 48 for the diameter to increase to six, 
64 for the diameter to increase to eight, 80 for diameter of 10, and 96 for diameter of 12.<p>

<a name="0513"></a><h4>0.5.1.3 Wish</h4>
Wish is a unique spell. It is very difficult to learn, 
probably impossible if the PC has teleportitis. Such PC's must travel to a location 
where teleportation is impossible, such as the the Assassin's Guild, the Tomb of the 
High Kings or the elemental temples (the desirability is in that order due to background 
corruption in all of those locations). Furthermore, PC's will usually reach Starving! 
status while attempting to learn Wish. Tactics to deal with this include eating a 
blessed stomfillia to become Bloated, waiting just until the PC returns to Satiated, 
then eating another blessed stomfillia. It may be necessary to drink additional 
satiating potions, such as potions of toughness or potential toughness, even when the 
double blessed stomafillia tactic is used. Alternatively, PC's without teleportitis 
can use a room that has the "rich flavour" special effect, where PC's will never 
become hungry. Wish is extraordinarly expensive to cast and also drains a random 
stat by -10 when cast. If the PC must cast it, be prepared for the stat drain. 
Plan to cast it in a special room that lowers spell costs, and on Silvernight or 
Darknight, if possible, according to the PC's alignment.<p>

<a name="0514"></a><h4>0.5.1.4 Other spells</h4>
Bless damages undead. Healing spells can be cast at monsters including companions (but don't
use them on slaves!). Lightning, Magic Missile, Stun Ray and Death Ray bolts will bounce off
the walls, but not doors.
Nothing is resistant to a Magic Missile. Magic Lock will close and lock a door in one turn.
Anywhere Earthquake generates rocks will be turned into a normal ground tile - this can be used 
to destroy water tiles and make them passable. 
Some spell durations stack. Bless, Strength of Atlas, Invisibility and Farsight all stack.
Calm Monster doesn't work on monsters generated in tension rooms, threat rooms and vaults. 
It just results in "The [monster] ignores your spell". In addition, arena opponents and 
Keethrax' animals won't be affected by the Calm Monster spell.<p>

<a name="0515"></a><h4>0.5.1.5 Learning spells mechanics</h4>
<b>Book charges</b><p>
Books start with 2d3 charges and disappear when it reaches 0. The number charges left is hidden to 
the player. Successfully reading a book deducts one charge.<p>

<b>Learning spells</b><p>
Reading a spellbook takes 3 + Cost turns, succeed or fail. "Shelves of books" room effect
halves this time. There are 11 possible bonuses to learning a spell:<p> 
<ol>
<li>We start off with class. Priests and Wizards have +30, Mindcrafters -40, other classes in between.
<li>Learning is counted in next; +1/8*Le for Barbarians, +3*Le for Wizards, and in between for others.  
<li>Next comes the difficulty based on the specific spellbook (Darkness and Light are lowest with +6, Wish is highest -100)
<li>Pure spellcasters (except Elementalists) attempting to learn purely arcane spells get -10, other combinations get +10.
<li>You are penalized -1 per remaining turn of drunkenness.
<li>You are rewarded +20 for a blessed book and penalized -20 for cursed. 
<li>You are rewarded for your level. Pure spellcasters get +Min(75,2*level). All other non-Mindcrafter non-trolls get +1*level. 
Mindcrafters and Troll non-casters get nothing.   
<li>+Concentration/5. 
<li>+Literacy/10.
<li>Druids and Necromancers receive +40 for their specific starting book, lightning bolt and frost bolt, respectively.
<li>Characters born under Book receive +20.
</ol><p>

All of this combines together for some kind of BaseValue. Now you 
choose whether to cast or read the book. If you read it, there's a 
straight up Literacy roll. Basically, your Literacy 
skill is a percentage chance of successfully reading the book. If you 
fail the check, you 'cannot decipher the runes' and nothing else 
happens (even with 100 Literacy there is 1% chance of automatic failure).
Now if BaseValue &gt; 1d100 you succeed in learning the spell. Otherwise, you fail.
SuccessMargin = BaseValue-1d100 previously rolled.<p>

<b>On success</b><p>
You gain castings and train Learning. Learning training is 2*Cost, or Cost/2 if you had 
some castings already. <p>
If ExistingCastings &lt; 30, then CastingsGained = 
Min(200 + Le*4, Max(20, Max(5, SuccessMargin - ExistingCastings) * Max(1, Le/4)));
else CastingsGained = Max(5, Max(1, Le/8) * SuccessMargin).<p> 

CastingsGained is then reduced by ExistingCastings and level -
CastingsGained *= (100 - 3 * (ExistingCastings/50 + lvl/3)) / 100. 
Reduction is never worse than 25% of previous value and never reduces CastingsGained 
below 1.<p>

Next, Cup is +20% CastingsGained, Good and Great Book Learner talents are each +10%.<p>

<b>On failure</b><p> 
If you fail to read the book successfully, it depends on SuccessMargin (negative in this case) plus a base 
value for each class (shown below) your chances of the book doing something nasty 
versus your chances to just not learning anything.<p>
<ul>
<li>50 - Wizard, Elementalist 
<li>40 - Priest, Necromancer 
<li>35 - Healer 
<li>30 - Bard, Druid 
<li>25 - Paladin, Ranger 
<li>20 - Thief, Assassin, Monk, Weaponsmith, Beastfighter, Merchant 
<li>15 - Fighter, Archer 
<li>10 - Farmer 
<li>-10 - Mindcrafter 
<li>-20 - Barbarian 
</ul><p>

If the value is now positive, nothing happens. Otherwise, you get a random penalty from the 11 equally
probable effects:<p>

<b>Summary</b><p>
To sum up, chance of successfuly learning a spell predominantly depends on class (pretty self explanatory to the extent 
spellcasters read better). Also birthsign (Book helps), whether you're drunk, the 
difficulty of the spellbook, whether you're a Mindcrafter/Troll, B/U/C status of the spellbook, Learning, Concentration, Literacy, 
and the PC's level factor in - the higher of these the better. <p>

Notation for spells:<p>
<ul>
<li> W - Willpower of the PC.
<li> M - Mana of the PC.
<li> L - Level of the PC.
<li> E - Spell Effectiveness for the given spell.
<li> R - Maximum range (as determined by the range formula).
<li> r - Remaining range points when target is hit.
<li>M{x, y} - take the maximum of x and y
<li>m{x, y} - take the minimum of x and y
</ul><p>

For Darkness, Light, and ball spells, "Range" means "Diameter". Chance
is relative probability of a spellbook to be generated. It also hints at spell difficulty. <p>

<a name="052"></a><h4>0.5.2 Writing scrolls</h4>
Scrolls can be written if the PC is literate, has seen an example of the scroll, has             
a magical writing set and a blank scroll to write on. Blank scrolls can be found in the 
dungeons (usually an unlabeled scroll, although this is not guaranteed), or they can be 
created by dipping other scrolls into *normal* water - not holy water or unholy water. 
Be aware that the cost for writing scrolls of chaos resistance is high - there is a 
permanent loss of two or three Mana points for *Wizards*, apparently depending on the
blessed vs uncursed status of the magical writing set. The Mana cost for non-wizards is
significantly higher, ten Mana points is typical. In addition, any combination of a
blessed MWS with an uncursed blank scroll or an uncursed MWS with a blessed or uncursed 
blank scroll will result in a loss of hitpoints. This loss ranged from 70 to 145 HP with 
a WADOMF'd experience level one Wizard PC. The HP loss may go down with increasing 
experience level for Wizards, but this has not been tested. The HP consequences for
non-wizards may be more dramatic (i.e. deadly).<p>

Writing other scrolls does not have such drastic consequences, though the exact effects 
have yet to be worked out. Scrolls which are particularly hard to write (in order of 
decreasing difficulty) include: scroll of chaos resistance (*10 Mana cost), scroll of education (*7), scroll of protection/defense (*6), 
scroll of increase melee accuracy/damage (*5), scroll of item creation (*4). Monks don't lose Mana 
when creating scrolls.<p>
<ul>
<li>Using Blessed equipment reduces the cost (both scroll and writing set). Cursed equipment increases it. 
<li>if Literacy < 1d130 the cost is increased; later you need to pass a straight Literacy roll to succeed at writing at all
<li>Wizards get a difficulty reduction here (halved, before scroll type is factored in). 
<li>Monks don't suffer the negative effects of writing a difficult scroll like other classes do. Wizards and Priests suffer the effects less than others (/2, /4). 
<li>Writing scrolls costs PP, and if your PP is too low you'll take damage.
</ul><p>

<a name="0531"></a><h4>0.5.3.1 Confusion blast</h4>
Note that Confusion Blast, available to experience level one Mindcrafters, works analogously to Ventriloquism
(see section <a href="adomgb-0-4.html">0.4</a>).
It confuses a monster who then does not alert other monsters on the level.
It has a range of 3 + (Willpower + Level) / 8 squares. If it hits an undead monster, the PC takes 4d4 damage (4d4/2 at level 50) 
and no further effect. Mindless monsters, including insects and the Eternal Guardian, are immune, as are all unlife.
Corrupting monsters will corrupt the PC as for a single melee hit (divided by 4 at level 32); however they ARE affected normally. 
The monster will not be affected if it passes a spell resistance save with an attack power of Level. If it is affected, it 
will be confused for Level + 1dWi-1 turns.<p>

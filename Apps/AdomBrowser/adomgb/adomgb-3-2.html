<h3>The Eternal Guardian</h3>
The Eternal Guardian is found one or two levels before the Casino. He guards the
down staircase on the level. He only allows peaceful passage of PCs if they are
wearing the Ring of the High Kings, obtainable from the Tomb of the High Kings 
(section <a href="adomgb-2-12.html">2.12</a>). It is definitely possible to pass him without the ring, although
it presents special problems. The obvious tactic of teleporting him away from
the stairs does not work, as he is resistant to teleportation. Trying to kill
him in melee or with missiles is more or less pointless, since he reincarnates 
even if the PC manages to kill him, which is very difficult. If a PC wants to
pass him without the RotHK, it is best to make him angry such that he chases the 
PC, followed by a quick teleport to the down stairs and descent.<p>

The vital statistics for the original Eternal Guardian:<p>
<pre>
You examine the eternal guardian. Your diagnosis: DV: 30, PV: 60, Hits: 1817.
</pre>
As mentioned if the PC does not teleport to the stairs immediately, a duplicate 
will appear. The vital statistics for the first duplicate:<p>
<pre>
You examine the eternal guardian. Your diagnosis: DV: 30, PV: 60, Hits: 2507.
</pre>
The trend is obvious. Fighting multiple copies of the Eternal Guardian is a
recipe for suicide. Or a recipe for lots of experience, if the PC is fast enough.
The Eternal Guardian is not especially fast, so hit and run tactics can be used.
He is vulnerable to humanoid slayers or ball spells. It takes a lot of either
to bring him down though.<p>

Even if the PC manages to pass him without the Ring of the High Kings, the 
shortcut to the surface through Darkforge 
(see section <a href="adomgb-3-4.html">3.4</a>) will not work in the 
down direction - a distinct disadvantage.<p>

It is possible to anger the Eternal Guardian, kill his hostile copies and still
pass peacefully by showing the Ring of the High Kings to the nonhostile copy
that remains on the stairs. This can be used to exploit the Eternal Guardian
for experience.<p>

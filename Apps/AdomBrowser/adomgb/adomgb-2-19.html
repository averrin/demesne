<h3>The Tower of Eternal Flames</h3>
<A HREF="adomgb-2-19-pic.html" target="blank">Click here</A> for a color map of the Fire Temple.<p>
The Tower of Eternal Flames, found in the Wilderness, is probably the nastiest place in 
the game given the experience level of PCs who must visit it. The layout of the Fire 
Temple itself, found on the uppermost of four levels, on the right side of the level, is 
as follows:<p>

<pre>
  #######
  #.....#                                       #########

The left side of the level is random. Note that the temple itself is disconnected. Entry 
must be made by digging.  Teleportation is not allowed on the level. Note the underscore 
in the center of the temple. This is the chaotic elemental altar where the orb guardian is 
found (at least until it is disturbed and moves). The elemental altars are very dangerous. 
The temples are populated by sentient beings who will sacrifice the PC instantly should he 
step on it. In addition, they can only be converted by champions of Balance or Order, which 
means PCs going for an ultra ending cannot convert them early in the game, before retrieving 
the Medal of Chaos. The monsters in the Fire Temple are arrayed as follows:<p>
<pre>

PCs are denied entrance to the lower CoC until they have the Chaos Orb of Elemental 
Fire, held by the Ancient Chaos Wyrm in the ToEF, and the game stalls at this point.  
PCs can continue to gain experience levels by staying on available cavernous levels 
(for instance) in order to have a better chance in the Tower. Ultimately, however,
boredom will set in and the PC will have to face the Tower. Obtaining the Fire
Orb is a huge hurdle to get over and marks a division between the earlier, 
beginning parts of the game and the latter parts of the game. Some players
also believe it marks the division between beginning and advanced players.<p>

The Tower of Eternal Flames consists of four levels. They are all very, very
hot. This causes damage to both the PC and his equipment, whether worn or in
the pack. To protect the PC, fire resistance or immunity is necessary. See
section <a href="adomgb-0-12.html#0c1">0.12.1</a> about fire resistance.<p>

To protect the PC (other than Drakelings, see below) completely from the heat
in the ToEF, the PC must have four sources of fire resistance.  Note that 
intrinsic fire resistance counts as two sources.  Thus, for example, a PC with 
intrinsic fire resistance wearing a ring of fire resistance under the elemental 
gauntlets would take no damage from the heat in the Tower.<p>

The fire damage PC takes if the following:<p>
<ul>
<li>no fire resistance - 10 dmg per turn
<li>1 source - 2 dmg per turn
<li>2 sources - 1 dmg per turn
<li>3 sources - 1 dmg per 2 turns
<li>4+ sources - no damage
</ul><p>

If the player has the Immune to Pain talent, two resistances are enough.<p>
There are a number of artifacts that grant fire resistance or immunity. Guaranteed
examples include the elemental gauntlets, the black torc (curses), the Ring of the
High Kings (all grant resistance), the Shield of Raw Steel (immunity, but corrupts)
and the Crown of Science (immunity, but also dooms and curses). There is a game bug
which causes fireproof blankets to be positively affected by the cursed and doomed
intrinsics; they seem to last indefinitely in the Tower. Assaulting the Tower with
these intrinsics is a dangerous choice, of course. It is difficult enough without
them. There are several other nonguaranteed artifacts which grant resistance or
immunity to fire. It is worth remembering that artifacts are indestructible and
so cannot be damaged by the heat in the Tower.<p>

Drakelings face special problems in the ToEF. The Mad Minstrel sings a song
about this. Drakelings, even those with fire immunity, always take damage in
the ToEF. This is not because of the heat itself but is a secondary effect due
to the greatly increased metabolism Drakelings will suffer from in the ToEF.
There is no way around it. In order to survive, Drakelings must have a means
of regeneration or healing in the ToEF. Ideally an artifact that causes
regeneration should be worn. An alternative is to bring blessed potions of
extra healing along. It is possible for Drakelings to do the ToEF with only
three or four blessed PoEH if everything is done efficiently with no wasted 
time.<p>

One technique Drakelings (and other races for that matter) can use is to read a
blessed scroll of magic mapping upon entering a new level of the ToEF followed 
by teleportation to the up stairway. Obviously the PC must have the necessary
scrolls, wands or spell and teleport control.<p>

The heat in the tower will destroy equipment that is vulnerable to fire.  
This includes most items that are not made of the higher metals mithril, 
adamantium and eternium. Rings of fire resistance will not be damaged.
Weapons and armor with the red prefix are also impervious to heat.<p>

If a PC must wear items vulnerable to fire, a blessed ring of ice is necessary.  
Uncursed rings of ice will not work, they must be blessed. Even with a blessed
ring of ice, some equipment destruction may occur. Blessed rings of ice seem
to protect to the 92-95% level. Even wearing two blessed rings of ice does not
guarantee worn equipment will not be destroyed, although the protection seems 
to go up to 99+%.  A ring of ice is of course not necessary if the PC wears only 
artifacts and items made of the higher metals. Missiles are an obvious problem.
It is rare to find enough arrows made from higher metals to satisfy an archer in 
the ToEF, for instance. Even rocks are vulnerable to the heat, sometimes
exploding. Non-artifact slings, bows and crossbows are liable to be burnt or
melted.<p>

This whole situation is very vexing, because the ToEF contains a very nasty 
collection of monsters and the PC naturally wants to bring his best equipment 
with him, but at the same time does not want it destroyed.<p>

One thing to remember - rings are never destroyed until the gauntlets worn over 
them are destroyed. Since the artifact elemental gauntlets are available to all
PCs, this provides a foolproof means of protecting nonartifact rings.<p>

The objective in the ToEF is of course the Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire. It is
held by the Ancient Chaos Wyrm who can be found on the top level of the ToEF.  
This level is typical of the levels containing elemental temples. The temple
itself occupies half of the level and is disconnected. It can only be reached
by digging. Teleportation is not allowed on the level. Since a PC may have his
only means of digging destroyed on his way through the tower, praying on the top 
level will result in a pickaxe gift from the PC's god. The piety level required
is 15000 piety. The PC must not be doomed or cursed. If he is using artifacts
that grant those intrinsics, remove them.<p>

The temple itself is occupied by problematic monsters. These include fire
elementals, chaos servants, fire grues, fire drakes and fire demons in addition 
to the orb guardian. The fire demons and fire grues in particular are annoying
because they have a corrupting melee attack with a very high to-hit. Even PCs
with excellent DV will be hit eventually. Taken as a whole, this means that
invisibility is very, very desirable in the Fire Temple.<p>

The only temple monsters that see in Darkness are fire demons and the Ancient Chaos
Wyrm. It is most useful for fighting the elementals. It is probably wise to dispel
the Darkness before tackling the ACW.<p>

Monsters (except possible vaults) who can be generated in the ToEF consist of the following:
fire beetle,     
fire lizard (double chance),
fire drake (thrice chance),
fire giant (thrice chance),
red baby dragon,
red dragon,
fire demon,
fire grue ,
fire elemental,
red worm (double chance),
fire giant,
fire giant king.<p>

<a name="2j1"></a><h4>2.19.1 The Ancient Chaos Wyrm</h4>
The Ancient Chaos Wyrm holds the Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire, the key to the 
lower parts of the CoC. It has a fire breath attack and a corrupting melee
attack. In addition it is able to cast confusion and an energy ray. It is
able to heal its wounds. The ACW can be killed in a variety of ways including
brute force, although it is preferable to attack it from a distance due to its 
corrupting melee attack. The ACW is vulnerable to cold attacks (as are most of
the monsters in the temple) and dragon slaying ammo. If it is killed on the
temple's altar, be extraordinarily careful! If the PC is visible the fire
demons will sacrifice him instantly. Even if the PC is invisible, fire demons
who have been engaged in melee will "know" where the PC is and sacrifice him.  
The safest thing to do is kick anything dropped on the altar to an adjacent 
square before picking it up. The elemental altars can only be converted by
champions of Balance or Order, which means PCs going for an ultra ending cannot 
convert them early in the game, before retrieving the Medal of Chaos.<p>

An examination of the Ancient Chaos Wyrm with a blessed stethoscope reveals:<p>
<pre>
You examine the Ancient Chaos Wyrm. Diagnosis: Level: 1, DV: 50, PV: 20, Hits:
209, Attacks: 3, Damage: 15-51. Speed: 98.
</pre>
This speed is probably not typical. Values around 130 are more common.<p>
The Ancient Chaos Wyrm holds holds the Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire, greater identified as follows:<p>
<pre>
-------------------- Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire {St+10} -------------------

It is an artifact.

When used in melee combat it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 2d9+3
points of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +3 bonus to hit and
causes 1d10+3 points of damage.

It modifies your strength attribute by +10.

It is possible to set certain default values for ADOM with the
standard configuration file.  The name of the file and its location
depends on the system you are playing ADOM on.  The system-related
readme file (readme.linux, readme.dos or readme.amiga) accompanying
this distribution will give you more details about this.  The
configuration file can contain certain variables which control parts
of ADOM's behaviour.  This file is a plain ASCII file.<p>

Generally a line in the configuration file can start with or without a
'#'.  If the line starts with a '#' it is considered to be a comment
and will be ignored.  Otherwise ADOM expects to find something that
looks like this:<p>
<pre>
        &lt;variable&gt; = &lt;value&gt;
</pre>
For example a line might contain the following text:<p>
<pre>
        Name = Big Bang
</pre>
or
<pre>
        Recovery = 400
</pre>
ADOM recognizes a certain number of variables which have a specific
meanings.  Each variable must have a value of a certain type.  Allowed
types are strings, numbers (only whole integers) and Boolean values
('true' and 'false').  Strings which contain whitespace must be
enclosed by ' (see above).<p>

ADOM variables also can be set during the game with the ': =' command
which requires the user to enter a line in the format explained above.
Invalid variables will be highlighted in red color.<p>

The following variables are currently recognized:<p>

<h4>Allow_Default_Names</h4>
true, false: defaults to 'false' and allows you to determine whether
the default names provided by ADOM for you will be used or not if
you press ENTER when asked to input a name

<h4>Auto_Open_Doors</h4>
true, false: will ask automatically whether you want to unlock a
locked door (if you have the appropriate key)

<h4>Auto_Lock_Doors</h4>
true, false: ADOM will automatically ask you whether you'd like to
lock a door while closing it, if you have an appropriate key.  By
default this variable is set to 'true'.

<h4>Auto_Lock_Nearest</h4>
true, false: if set to true, the targeting code (used for missile
weapons and a few spells) will automatically use the nearest monster
as the new target, if no monster was locked before.

<h4>Auto_Pickup</h4>
string containing the symbols of items chosen from the following
categories, which are to be picked up whenever you move on a field
containing items of that type:
<pre>
          [  Armor, shields, cloaks, boots, girdles, gauntlets and helmets
          *  Gems
          o  Rocks
          ]  Tools
          '  Necklaces
          (  Melee weapons
          }  Missile weapons
          /  Missiles
          =  Rings
          \  Wands
          !  Potions
          ?  Scrolls
          ~  Bracers
          %  Food
          $  Gold
          {  Instruments
          "  Books
</pre>
<h4>Auto_Select_Doors</h4>
true, false: if set to false, ADOM won't try to determine the appropriate
door in the vicinity of your PC when you try to open or close a door. The
default value is true.

<h4>Base_Delay_Factor</h4>
number: determines the number of hundreds of a second ADOM delays
actions (like two steps for a fireball, etc.).  The default value is
10.  To prevent input errors ADOM only accept values in the range
of 0 to 100.

<h4>Check_Item_In_Hand</h4>
true, false: if set to 'true' you will be asked if you want to wield
an item other than a pick axe, a torch or a melee weapon

<h4>Class</h4>
any of the available classes

<h4>Class_Mask</h4>
string consisting of characters chosen from the following list:
<pre>
        a - Fighter
        b - Paladin
        c - Ranger
        d - Thief
        e - Assassin
        f - Wizard
        g - Priest
        h - Bard
        i - Monk
        j - Healer
        k - Weaponsmith
        l - Archer
        m - Merchant
        n - Farmer
        o - Mindcrafter
        p - Barbarian
        q - Druid
        r - Necromancer
        s - Elementalist
        t - Beastfighter
</pre>
If you choose to randomly select your class (with the 'F'ate option
during character creation) the classes in 'Class_Mask' won't be
selected.  Thus you can cross out certain classes you do not like.

<h4>Colored_Menus</h4>
true, false: if set to 'false' you won't have to endure the colored
menus (and yes, there probably will be configurable colors for the
menus at some point in the future although it's pretty low priority
for me).

<h4>Colored_PC</h4>
true, false: if set to 'false' the player icon '@' will be displayed
in white -- otherwise the color is dependent on your class.

<h4>Compact_Kill_List</h4>
true, false: if set to 'true' the final kill list will be compacted by
printing more than just one killed monster type per line.

<h4>Display_Key_Code</h4>
true, false: if set to 'true' you will see the keys you pressed during
a multi-key command

<h4>Fast_Missile_Readying</h4>
true, false: will prompt you whether you want to add a (heap of)
missiles to your missile slot when the missile slot is empty

<h4>Fast_More</h4>
true, false: if set to 'true' any key will be accepted when the
'(more)' prompt is displayed.  Setting this variable to 'true' is
equivalent to pressing 'C-k' once at the start of the game.

<h4>Fated_Gender</h4>
true, false: if set to true, ADOM will select the gender for your character

<h4>Item_Status_Color</h4>
One of the following constants:
<pre>
          blue
          green
          cyan
          red
          magenta
          brown
          light gray
          dark gray
          light blue
          light green
          light cyan
          light red
          light magenta
          yellow
          white
</pre>
This definition determines the color of inventory entries that have been
succesfully identified. The traditional setting is 'light gray'.

<h4>Low_Hitpoint_Warning</h4>
true, false: if set to true ADOM will beep (or flash the screen if
beeping is impossible but flashing is possible on your system) if the
hitpoints of your character fall below 20% (or 15 -- whichever is
lower).

<h4>Message_Buffer_Size</h4>
A number, which describes the size of the message buffer in lines. The
value is required to be between 50 and 10000.

<h4>Metric_Measuring</h4>
true, false; if set to true, your height and weight will be printed
according to metric measuring

<h4>Name</h4>
the default name for your PC

<h4>Nice_Stuff</h4>
true, false: if set to true the stuff list will display cursed items in
red and blessed items in green.

<h4>No_Book_Spellcasting</h4>
true, false: If set to true you no longer will be prompted about
whether to learn a spell from a book or cast it from the book.

<h4>Persistence</h4>
a numeric value; determines the number of steps that will pass when
you use the 'walk mode' to search in one place (see -> Continuous
search via 'w s'); the default value is 20

<h4>Questioned_Attributes</h4>
true, false: determines whether the player will be allowed to determine
the PC attributes by answering questions. The default value is 'true'.

<h4>Quitters_Allowed</h4>
true, false: if set to 'true' all games in which you quit will also be
recorded in the highscore

<h4>Race</h4>
any of the allowed races -- don't forget the ' for races like High Elf

<h4>Race_Mask</h4>
a string consisting of one or more of the following characters:
<pre>
        a - Human
        b - Troll
        c - High Elf
        d - Gray Elf
        e - Dark Elf
        f - Dwarf
        g - Gnome
        h - Hurthling
        i - Orc
        j - Drakeling
</pre>
If you choose to randomly select your race (with the 'F'ate option
during character creation) the races in 'Race_Mask' won't be
selected.  Thus you can cross out certain races you do not like.

<h4>Random_PC</h4>
true, false; determines whether a randomly rolled character will be
used each time you start ADOM

<h4>Recovery</h4>
a numeric value; determines the number of steps that will pass when
you use the 'walk mode' to wait in one place; the default value is 50

<h4>Reload_Missiles</h4>
true, false: if set to true, ADOM will query you, whether you want to
equip another missile once you run out of ammunition.

<h4>Reverse_Message_Order</h4>
true, false: determines the order in which the messages are displayed
in the message buffer; true means that the latest messages will be
displayed at the bottom, false means that the latest messages will be
displayed at the top; 'true' is the default value

<h4>Sex</h4>
male, female

<h4>Short_Log_Format</h4>
string: the string is used by ADOM to create a log file.  The string
contains one character for each set of information to be included in
the log file. The following options can be used:
<pre>
        a: Achievements (attribute changes, ...)
        b: Background of the PC
        c: Spells
        d: PC data (attributes, ...)
        e: Effects of corruption
        i: Items in the inventory
        k: Kill list of the PC
        l: Skills
        m: Items in the backpack
        s: Screenshot
        w: Weapon skills
</pre>
The default is: "dbim".

<h4>Show_Experience</h4>
true, false: if set to 'true' ADOM will display all experience points the
PC gains

<h4>Sorted_Skills</h4>
true, false: if set to 'true' the skill list will be ordered
alphabetically

<h4>Starvation_Warning</h4>
true, false: if set to 'true', ADOM will beep if you are in danger of
starving.

<h4>Uncursed_String</h4>
string: some people don't seem to like the word 'uncursed' ADOM uses
to describe an item that is neither cursed nor blessed.  You can
define an alternative by using this environment variable.  Be careful
about what you do since ADOM does not check your definition and using
'cursed' or 'blessed' is possible, too.  Moral: he who confuses
himself gets what he deserves.

<h4>Verbose_Level_Messages</h4>
true, false: defaults to 'false'; if set to 'true', level messages
will be displayed whenever you enter a special level, otherwise only
on the first time

<h4>Verbose_Log_Format</h4>
string: This string has the same format as 'Short_Log_Format'.  ADOM
internally does not care about the format of the two strings (and
which one is longer).  The intention of these two environment
variables simply is to allow the user to have two different means of
creating a logfile.  The default is: "sdbwcleimka".

<h4>Walk_Carefully</h4>
true, false: if set to 'true' ADOM will abort from Walk-Mode as soon
as you spot a non-tame monster.

<h4>Zap_Wands_In_Hand</h4>
true, false: if set to 'true' ADOM will ask whether to zap wands
currently equipped in the left or right hand.  Otherwise such equipped
wands will be ignored.<p>

If you initially do not have a configuration file, ADOM will create
one for you.<p>

<a name="U2"></a><h3>APPENDIX C: Command Line Options</h3>
ADOM can be supplied with some command line options to make it do
certain things.  Up to now the following command line options are
supported:<p>
<ul>
<li>        <tt>-b</tt>: display the license for the game binary
<li>        <tt>-c &lt;file&gt;</tt>: forces ADOM to use <file> as configuration file
<li>        <tt>-d</tt>: display the directories being used
<li>        <tt>-D</tt>: display meta-game data
<li>        <tt>-h</tt>: display the available command line options
<li>        <tt>--help</tt>: display this help text
<li>        <tt>-k</tt>: use the standard keymap
<li>        <tt>-l &lt;name&gt;</tt>: load the saved game <name>
<li>        <tt>-m</tt>: use monochrome display
<li>        <tt>-n</tt>: forbids ADOM to use any configuration file
<li>        <tt>-o</tt>: prints the used compiler options
<li>        <tt>-r</tt>: create keymap reference file 'keyref.kbd'
<li>        <tt>-s</tt>: displays the complete highscore
<li>        <tt>-S</tt>: dump complete highscore to 'hiscore.doc'
<li>        <tt>-t&lt;maxnum&gt;</tt>: save RNG test in 'rngtest.txt'
<li>        <tt>-T&lt;maxnum&gt;</tt>: save RNG series test in 'rngstest.txt'
<li>        <tt>-v</tt>: display the current version of ADOM.
</ul><p>
The syntax for calling ADOM with options is:<p>
<pre>
         adom [-b] [-c &lt;file&gt;] [-d] [-D] [-h] [--help] [-k] [-l &lt;name&gt;] [-m]
              [-n] [-o] [-r] [-s] [-S][-t&lt;maxnum&gt;] [-T&lt;maxnum&gt;] [-v]
</pre>
Important note: If you have changed the default keymap, but would like
to have a reference file of the original bindings, you need to call
ADOM like this:<p>
<pre>
         adom -k -r
</pre>
(It's important that the '-k' is set before the '-r'!)<p>

<a name="U3"></a><h3>APPENDIX D: Customizing the Keymap</h3>
ADOM allows you to customize the keybindings used during the game for
invoking commands to a certain extent.  When ADOM is started it
searches for a file called 'adom.kbd' (or '.adom.kbd' on Linux
systems) in your data directory (call 'adom -d' to determine your data
directory).  This file contains a description of its syntax, which
should answer all questions.  Customizing a keymap to a very specific
system requires quite some work on your side if you want to use
special keys and such stuff (you will need to know the ASCII codes
your system generates when a special key is pressed).<p>

Note that customization is possible only to a certain extent.<p>

If you would like to have a printed reference of your own keymap
bindings at hand, you can enter<p>
<pre>
         adom -r
</pre>
at your command prompt.  This will make ADOM to create a file called
'keyref.kbd', which contains the current bindings and can be printed
on any line printer.  Check it for the details about how to define new
key bindings.<p>

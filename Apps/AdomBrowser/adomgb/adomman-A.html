<a name="A1"><h3>Introduction</h3>
Ancient Domains of Mystery (ADOM for short) is a rogue-like game
which means that it is a single-user game featuring the exploration of
a dungeon complex.  You control a fictional character described by
race, class, attributes, skills, and equipment.  This fictional
character is trying to achieve a specific goal (see below) and succeed
in a difficult quest.  To fulfill the quest, you have to explore
previously undiscovered tunnels and dungeons, fight hideous monsters,
uncover long forgotten secrets, and find treasures of all kind.<p>

During the game, you explore dungeon levels which are randomly
generated each game.  You might also encounter certain special levels,
which present a particular challenge or are built around a certain
theme.<p>

IMPORTANT: If you are a first-time player you should read the 'How to
start' section of this manual.<p>

<a name="A2"><h3>Coming of Chaos</h3>
For 6000 years, the world of Ancardia was left untouched by the
incursions of Chaos, but finally the sinister forces of evil and
darkness have found this young and teeming world.  In a remote
mountain complex, huge dungeons were formed by great magical powers.
They seem to contain some kind of dimensional gate which allows
terrors from unknown dimensions to enter the world of Ancardia and
wreak havoc.<p>

For years, nobody understood the true cause of sudden ambushes by evil
monsters, incursions by hideous monster armies, and the rising tide of
Chaos.  Finally Khelavaster, the great sage, uncovered an ancient
prophecy foretelling the Coming of Chaos -- a dark and sinister time
when the skill, power and valor of a single hero would determine the
future of the world.  The ancient scrolls of prophecy hinted at a
remote mountain range -- the Drakalor Chain -- which was destined to
be the final battle ground for an epic fight between Chaos and Order.
Khelavaster quickly made this known to all the intelligent races of
Ancardia.<p>

Within weeks, many heroes set out to find the source of the chaotic
forces and destroy it.  Khelavaster was among the first to enter those
dungeons.  Many heroes have followed him since then but no one has
ever returned from the dungeons.  Thus the forces of Chaos continue
their conquest and threaten to defile Ancardia...<p>

You are one of those young heroes willing to risk your life to defeat
the forces of Chaos, gain fame, fortune, power, and ultimately save
your world and your people.  After weeks of arduous travel, you have
finally reached the center of the Drakalor Chain and now face the
entrance to those dungeons of mystery which must contain a means to
save your world.  You were told to visit a small village by the name
of "Terinyo" and talk to the village elder for he might have the
latest information about the region.  Steady yourself and be prepared
to engage in a heroic struggle for the fate of your home world!<p>

<a name="A3"><h3>The Price of the Game</h3>
ADOM is available for free as long as you honor the license of the
game (either see the file 'license.doc' or type 'adom -b' at your
command line).  If you want to thank me (Thomas Biskup) for creating
ADOM, maintaining it, fixing all discovered bugs, providing support
and generally spending a lot of time on the game and if you are having
fun with the game, please consider rewarding my efforts by sending a
postcard to the following address from wherever you are living:<p>
<pre>
                Thomas Biskup
                Timmerbrinksweg 37

</pre>
I *love* receiving postcards from all over the world.  Weigh the fun
ADOM gave you against the ten minutes you probably need to
write and send such a postcard -- and if you find that you like and
enjoy the game -- please do it.  I'm really not asking much... am I?<p>

<a name="A4"><h3>To further the development of the game</h3>
ADOM contains a number of bugs as is normal for one huge piece of
software being developed by a single person (about 135,000 lines of
code as of ADOM 0.9.9 Gamma 13). Thus it's absolutely necessary to
send bug reports in to me if you experience problems with the game.<p>

Bug reports are submitted at<p>

<a href="http://www.adom.de/adom/submit-report.php3">http://www.adom.de/adom/submit-report.php3</a><p>

and should contain at least the following information:

<ol>
<li>your real life name and your email address
<li>the version of ADOM you are using (exact version)
<li>the operating system you are using (exact version)
<li>a description on what you did to produce the error
<li>all dumps ADOM might have created
</ol><p>

Unless asked you should *not* include any binary files.<p>

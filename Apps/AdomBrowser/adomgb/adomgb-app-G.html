<tr><th>Special<th>Meaning
<tr><td>1<td>unidentified appear as strange herb; can be identified by picking with the Herbalism skill; more on herbs see <a href="adomgb-0-13.html#0d6">0.13.6</a>
<tr><td>2<td>susceptible to rotting
<tr><td>3<td>unidentified appear as bit of candy; can be identified by taste: plain = 'sweet', gnomish = 'annoyingly sweet'; children and Blup will only accept plain candy
<tr><td>4<td>unidentified appear as seed
<tr><td>5<td>more nutritious for Dark Elves: cursed = 2010, uncursed =  1020, blessed = 125; this unusual fact is in fact intentional
<tr><td>6<td>more nutritious for Orcs (2x), Trolls (3x), Barbarians (3x) and Beastfighters (3x); if a PC falls into more than one category, only the higher bonus applies - i.e. Orcish Beastfighters are 3X; Drakelings receive a different message than other races but get the usual 500 satiation points
<tr><td>7<td>Fried fish meat indeed has a fractional weight. If a stack of fried fish meat contains an odd number of pieces, the weight of the stack is rounded up
<tr><td>8<td>tames black hurthlings

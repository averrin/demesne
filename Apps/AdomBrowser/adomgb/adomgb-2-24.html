<h3>The Quickling Tree</h3>
<A HREF="adomgb-2-24-pic.html" target="blank">Click here</A> for a color map of the quickling tree.<p>
The Quickling Tree can be found in any portion of the forested
wilderness west of the river. This means that a PC should 's'earch
for it in a convenient place, such as next to the Mad Minstrel's
clearing. It can be found at any time, but to actually enter it
usually requires two corruptions: the extrememly thin and nimble
and the very light corruptions. This is because the PC must weigh
no more than ten kilos to enter the tree. Hurthlings are often an
exception: they can enter the quickling tree with only the thin 
and nimble corruption (which is required under any circumstances).
Also, the weight of the PCs inventory is limited to 160 stones.
This means eternium plate mails, crowns of leadership and the 
like are not going to be useful. In fact it is worth picking up 
any light armor the PC finds throughout the game and identifying
all of it at some point in case any of it is useful in the
Quickling Tree.<p>

Quicklings use hand crossbows and dark elven quarrels as missile 
weapons and drop them as they are killed. Some prior experience
with crossbows is therefore useful. Quicklings fall fairly easily
in melee, with missile weapons or using magic. They are just very,
very fast. Only the king and queen see in darkness and see invisible.<p>

The whole point of entering the Quickling Tree is to eat the corpses 
of the quicklings as they are killed, which provides speed bonuses.  
There are plenty of corpses generated for a PC with a good Food 
Preservation skill, so an amulet of hunger or stomacemptia herbs are 
useful in the tree. As would be expected, the higher level quickling
corpses give better speed bonuses, so the quickling lord corpses 
should be eaten first. The tree contains a quickling king and
quickling queen, whose corpses provide the best speed bonuses if they 
are generated, but they also shorten the PC's life span. This is where
those potions of longevity come in handy for races with relatively 
short life spans.<p>

Monsters generated in the Quickling Tree are:
75% quickling, 20% quickling lord, 3% quickling king, 2% quickling queen.<p>

The original quickling queen stands on a pair of artifact boots, the Boots of 
Great Speed, greater identified as follows:<p>
<pre>
---------------- boots of great speed [+5, +0] (+30 spd)--------------

When worn it modifies DV by +5 and PV by +0.
When used in melee combat it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes
1d3 points of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus
to hit and causes 1d2 points of damage.

It contains the essence of Chaos and Corruption.
It modifies your speed by +30.
It grants bad luck.
Wearing it makes you doomed.
</pre>

If it is desired, the PC may tunnel directly south from the entrance 
room into the room containing the high level quicklings.<p>

Time passes very quickly in the quickling tree. It is not unusual
to enter on day 70 and find that it is day 140 upon emerging. This
means the 90 day limit has passed and background corruption will 
become faster. Ideally a PC will do the Quickling Tree right before
the final dive to the lowest levels of the CoC. <p>

<h3>Unresolved mysteries</h3>

<a name="51"></a><h4>5.1 Kherab's third quest and the reward</h4>
When your PC has done the first two quests for Kherab, the dwarven 
artificer in Darkforge, he tells your character to "be patient, more 
will have to be done soon". However, he will never assign the third 
quest, even to experience level 50 characters who are ready to close 
the chaos gate or attempt an ultra ending. From scanning the 
executable, reference to a "spear of raw steel" has been found, 
seemingly a third quest reward along with the amulet of raw steel and 
shield of raw steel now available.<p>

<a name="52"></a><h4>5.2 The Scroll of Omnipotence</h4>
In the secret compartment of the High Mountain Village, there's a message 
that reads:<p>
<pre>
"Dear Lubaf, I am sorry to disappoint you but you won't be able to find the 
Scroll of Omnipotence in this place. I have hidden it more effectively.
You will need to find the red rooster at dawn. Then you'll encounter the final 
challenge.

With passionate hate,
 Alhacrast, Overlord of Jak-Nagiur."
</pre>
This may be what Khelavaster refers to as the foolish legends that built up 
around the quest for the crumpled scroll and the Trident of the Red Rooster.

Upon further examination of the executable, it seems the Scroll of Omnipotence could 
only be read by champions of Order/Balance/Chaos:
<pre>
You read the scroll of omnipotence

As you read the scroll you suddenly feel great power surging through your body. 
You feel invincible and your abilities are increased by enourmous amounts! 
Now you are a true champion of %s!

...ripped to pieces by trying to claim power not meant for %s..
Immediately you realize that this was a big mistake as you 
are not prepared for the wave of power that suddenly floats your body. You 
are ripped to pieces almost instantly!....
</pre>

<a name="53"><h4>5.3 The Red Rooster Inn</h4>
The Red Rooster Inn is mentioned in the executable and is probably a red 
herring. It was thought in earlier versions of ADOM that the innkeeper 
would produce the Trident of the Red Rooster in the Red Rooster Inn at 
dawn.<p>

The executable contains the following texts:<p>
<pre>
You enter the Red Rooster Inn. It's completely empty...

You enter the Red Rooster Inn as the sun is just rising. Alganon, the innkeeper,
welcomes you with great joy and honors you for helping the ancient dwarf. As
a reward he grants you a long item wrapped in a sheet. He winks at you and
mumbles "Ye know what'ta do with dat, don't ye?". Due to some urgent business
Alganon then leaves.
</pre>

<a name="54"></a><h4>5.4 The Volcano</h4>
There is a volcano mentioned in the executable, but no character has ever 
found such a location. It may be a remnant left over from earlier development 
of ADOM, possibly designed to be the location where the Chaos Orb of Elemental 
Fire could be found prior to implementation of the Tower of Eternal Flames. 
Deeper analysis shows a volcano is just an unimplemented dungeon feature.<p>

<a name="55"></a><h4>5.5 The Weird Tome</h4>
The Ghost Librarian in the Library of Niltrias demands silence. In practice, 
this means the PC must spend a certain amount of time in the Library without 
speaking. Spellcasting is allowed. After spending 2000 turns 
(well spent reading spellbooks) without speaking, upon 'C'hatting 
with him, he gives the PC the Weird Tome. He instructs the PC to deliver it to 
the Mad Minstrel, who will in turn reward the PC with five cursed scrolls of 
chaos resistance.<p>

The mystery about the book is the fact that nobody has managed to read it.<p>

Scanning the executable gives some further hints on successfull reading of the tome: <p>
<pre>
... manage to decipher the secret.
It describes a means to find the scroll of omnipotence.
... have to %s to find it.
</pre>

Giving the tome to saved invisible Khelavaster in Terinyo results in:<p>
<pre>
Khelavaster, the invisible ancient sage, curiously looks at the uncursed
weird tome. "Huh? Oh, I have read that a long time ago. Pretty intresting."
Khelavaster, the invisible ancient sage, drops the uncursed weird tome.
</pre>

Giving Weird Tome to Gaab'Baay, results in: <p>
<pre>
Gaab'Baay, the old crone, hastily accepts the uncursed weird tome.
Gaab'Baay, the old crone, examines the uncursed weird tome closely.
Gaab'Baay, the old crone, cackles: "Na, I don't need this." Gaab'Baay, the
old crone, drops the uncursed weird tome.
</pre>
Demented ratling eats the tome. Elder Chaos god is ignorant and refuses the tome 
from "puny mortal". Other unique characters simply refuse the tome.<p>

more details about the Ghost Librarian and the Weird Tome.<p>

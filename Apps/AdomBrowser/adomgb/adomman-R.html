<a name="R1"></a><h3>Shops</h3>
On certain levels of the dungeon, adventurous merchants have opened
their shops to provide supplies for the various bold adventurers
exploring the dungeons.  The risky environment is made up for by the
huge gains possible by selling rare (and even magical!) items to heroes
venturing down the dungeons.  Since most of them are carrying large
amounts of gold, the trade seems to be going very well.  Needless to
say that only daring and powerful merchants are willing to undertake
the risks of opening shops deep in the dungeons.<p>

If you enter a shop, you will be expected to look around, barter and
buy stuff.  You can leave without buying or selling anything, but
remember that at times shops might contain important or powerful
items.<p>

To buy something in a shop, you have to pick it up first.  The
shopkeeper then will block the exit (there seem to be so many thieves
around nowadays) and wait for you to pay (which is done by using the
'p' command).  If you do not have enough money, you probably will have
to leave the item(s) behind.<p>

You can also sell items in a shop to raise more funds.  Not every
shop will buy everything as most of them are rather specialized
(e.g. on potions or scrolls).  If you want to sell something, just
drop that item.  The shopkeeper will immediately tell you how much he
is willing to pay and then you can decide whether or not to accept the
offer.<p>

<a name="R2"></a><h3>Wishing</h3>
In ADOM you might encounter magical wishes.  Wishes are a powerful
form of magic which allows a variety of effects.<p>

ADOM supports two types of wishes.  You can wish for abstract things
and concepts like friends, money, wealth, strength, health, and other
things.<p>

You can also wish for items.  Such wishes can be very useful, since
ADOM features many powerful and rare items.  If you do not want to
wait for a certain item, just wish for it as soon as you receive a
free wish.  Since wishes are powerful but not very precise magic, you
can only wish for very general items.  For example, it's not possible
to wish for 6 blessed long swords (+6, 1d8+6), but you would rather
have to wish for long swords or mithril plate mails. If your wish is
not formulated precisely you might get something other than what you
are expecting -- so be careful!<p>

<a name="R3"></a><h3>Saving the Game</h3>
To save a game in progress you just have to press the 'S' key and
answer the following question with a 'y'.  The game will be saved and
you can restore it later to continue your game.  You should make sure
that you have enough free space on your disc before saving the game
as ADOM will otherwise crash.  You need about 30000 bytes plus 12000
bytes per level that you have explored.  Levels with lots of monsters
or items need more space.  Generally three free megabytes should be
enough for any one game (no matter how deep you venture).
	Note that the game will quit upon saving. Note also that
your save file will be deleted if your character dies. This is a
special feature of all roguelike games. You are expected to win
without ever dying.<p>

To restore a saved game, just start ADOM and type 'r' on the option
screen. If you choose that option a tiny menu will display the
available games to be restored (if there are any).  Please note that
this menu only displays a maximum of 20 saved games (without telling
you that there might be additional saved games).  This should be
sufficient for most purposes.  Depending on your screen resolution
even less games might be shown (e.g. 16 under DOS).<p>

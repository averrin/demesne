<h3>Generation of the R pentomino</h3>

It is almost inevitable for a stable square herb pattern to form spontaneously.
Alternatively, one can be generated. Once a square is generated, the PC needs
to generate only one additional bush to form the R pentomino pattern, which
grows explosively. Follow the steps shown below:<p>

<pre>
 . = empty, no change
 o = alive, boring
 + = added by you
 - = killed by you
 n = generated by rules
 k = killed by rules

.....  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....
.....  .....  .+...  .kn..  ..o..  ..o..
..oo.  ..oo.  ..oo.  .noo.  .ooo.  .ooo.
..oo.  ..o-.  ..o..  ..on.  ..-o.  ...o.
.....  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....
</pre>

This pattern will then grow for dozens of generations.<p>

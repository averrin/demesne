<h3>The Bug-Infested Temple</h3>
100 PC deaths (or 100 generated PC's) must be recorded in the adom.cnt file 
before entry will be allowed. (Replace contents of the file with four spaces to get entry). 
There are no experience or level requirements for entry, either for the PC or 
in the HISCORE file.<p>

Most of the level is diggable, but there are undiggable walls blocking 
most of the useful digging routes. Here is a picture of 
the level showing exactly which walls are diggable:
<a href="bugcav.gif" alt="digging in bugcav">BUGCAV</a><p>

The red walls are undiggable, the little yellow line shows about the 
only useful digging route, and the light gray walls are secret doors.<p>

The bug temple has been beefed up considerably since 1.0.0 with the simple addition of the
see invisible intrinsic for the bugs. Low (or even high) level spellcasters are no longer
going to be able to finish this area easily.<p>

The rewards have been toned down: only three SoCRs, six PoUH, eight SoMM. The 
wand of fireballs has ten charges, the wand of teleportation has six charges.<p>

of the bug-infested temple.<p>

The bug-infested temple consists of two parts: the bug wilderness
(BUGWIL) and bug cave (BUGCAV). The wilderness part's outer limits are
scattered with greater claw bugs, that low-level spellcasters can bolt
to death (be very cautious!). Around the down staircase, there are eight 
killer bugs.<p>

Note that both greater claw bugs and killer bugs have high speed, breed,
have multiple attacks and bypass the PC's PV. This means that they are what
they're called - killers - in melee.<p>

Eating a greater claw bug corpse increases speed, gives +3 Dx and -6 Wi.
Eating a killer bug corpse also increases speed, gives +6 Dx and -12 Wi.
The increases are no longer guaranteed in ADOM 1.1.1; the upper limit seems
to be around 30.<p>

The 'g's are greater claw bugs and 'i's are killer bugs. ]'s represent
named marble statues. The numeral 1 represents secret doors. Teleportation 
doesn't work in BUGCAV, and digging is very limited.<p>

All the marble statues can be picked up and broken, like normal ones.
However, there's another meaning to them; reading. They're in place to
honor the prerelease testing group of version 1.0.0. Here's a
compilation of what they all mean and what you get from them, besides rocks. <p>

</table><p>

Note that some of the rewards' stats may vary and that they are all
*cursed*. However, those potions of ultra healing, scrolls of magic
mapping and especially the scrolls of chaos resistance are a gift that
makes visiting the Bug Cave very worthwhile.<p>

There is one more statue, an "unfinished statue of an unquestionably
famous hero" in honor of Raymond Martineau. No reward for breaking him
down, though.<p>

Breaking the center statue and the statue ten squares west + one north stops
the breeding of the bugs and results in an appropriate line in the accomplishment
list at the end of the game.<p>

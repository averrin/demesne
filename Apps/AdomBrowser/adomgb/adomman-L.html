<h3>Corruptions</h3>
The forces of Chaos slowly start to get a grip on the world of
Ancardia.  Rumor has it that the dark magic used by the forces of
Chaos and their presence itself have corrupting effects on all living
beings on Ancardia and even on the environment itself.  Strange
mutants have been sighted and formerly normal humans suddenly were
horribly changed.<p>

Be prepared to be faced with these dangers and try to avoid becoming
transformed into a horrible being of Chaos.  Although the powers might
seem advantageous, they nearly always will bring doom (or so they
say).<p>

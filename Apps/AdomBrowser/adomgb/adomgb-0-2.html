<a name="02"></a><h3>Alignment and Altars</h3>
<a name="021"></a><h4>0.2.1 What is alignment?</h4>
Alignment reflects the moral nature of the PC. For example, PCs with lawful alignment
generally do not slaughter innocents or steal from shops. Chaotic PCs will do these
things and a lot worse besides. Neutral PCs choose from both options, doing nasty things
when necessary to further their cause, but also performing good acts to maintain their 
balanced alignment.<p>

A general and quite complete description of alignment can be found in the <a href="adomman-D.html#D1">ADOM Manual</a>.
It is assumed that the reader is familiar with that description. The effects alignment 
have on gameplay are discussed here. The effects are mostly evident to the player in terms 
of the quests and rewards that are available.<p>

<a name="022"></a><h4>0.2.2 Changing alignment</h4>
Alignment can range from -10000 to +6000 as follows:<p> 
<ul>
<li>C-: -10000 to -5000 
<li>C : -4999 to -1251 
<li>CN: -1250 to -1000 
<li>NC: -999 to -750 
<li>N-: -749 to -126 
<li>N=: -125 to +125 
<li>N+: +126 to +749 
<li>NL: +750 to +999 
<li>LN: +1000 to +1250 
<li>L : +1251 to +4999 
<li>L+: +5000 to +6000 
</ul><p>

<a name="0221"></a><h4>0.2.2.1 Chaotic acts</h4>
Changing alignment can be done in several ways. It is easy to change from a lawful flavor 
of alignment to a chaotic one. The PC need only commit chaotic acts, which include the following:<p>

<b>Repeatable chaotic acts</b><p>
<ul>
<li>attacking non-hostile monsters, especially innocent ones (child, cute dog)
<li>killing lawful monsters, such as blink dogs or white unicorns, even when hostile
<li>killing a white unicorn: -2000 
<li>wearing an amulet of chaos, available from Hotzenplotz
<li>pickpocketing: -50 if N- or higher
<li>robbing shops: worst in Lawenilothehl
<li>permanently pissing off a town
<li>digging graves: -100
<li>eating undead corpses
<li>creating undead slaves: -300
<li>attacking monsters with a weapon of vampirism: -1 every time HP is drained
<li>wearing armor of chaos
<li>reading tract of chaos
<li>causing an explosion that injures/kills friendly/tame creatures: -500 or -750
<li>attacking with the Scythe of Corruption: -Damage Dealt
<li>chopping trees in Terynio: -10
<li>giving meat to animals: -10
<li>sacrificing friendly monsters
<li>using Ventriloquism: -10
<li>destroying lawful altar: -1500, other altars: -200
<li>using Necromancer's lvl 25 Shadow Touch: -Damage dealt (sometimes)
</ul><p>

<b>One time chaotic acts</b><p>
<ul>
<li>learning Pick Pockets skill: -100
<li>telling the tiny girl you killed her dog: -600
<li>killing the Sheriff: -50
<li>killing the Healer: -200
<li>sacrificing the Healer: -2000 
<li>using Ventriloquism on Thrundarr: -1000
<li>digging Griffs grave: -250                                      
<li>telling Blup you killed his mom: -1000
<li>completing Ratling Rebel's request to kill the Arena Master: -500
<li>killing the Greater White Unicorn (Yrruir): -4000
<li>completing Gaab'Bay quest: -1000
<li>completing Greater Black Unicorn quest: -2000
</ul><p>

<a name="0222"></a><h4>0.2.2.2 Lawful acts</h4>
Changing from chaotic towards 
neutrality and law is more difficult. The following actions move the PC towards lawful:<p>

<b>Repeatable lawful acts</b><p>
<ul>
<li>killing certain chaotic monsters, notably most dragons, demons, grues, 
some giants, steel golems and most chaos monsters
<li>killing a black unicorn: +100
<li>wearing an amulet of order, available from Tywat Pare
<li>giving food or gold to beggars: +1 for every 20 gp, max +50 (1000 gp)
<li>giving seeds to farmers, or trading tools for rations with them: +1-10
<li>giving healing potions or stethoscope to village elder: +50-250
<li>giving outlaw typefcorpses to sheriff: +5-1000
<li>giving candy to children or Blup: +2 or +10
<li>healing the PC's pet (only when actually injured)
<li>self-flagellation, using a whip in the tool slot
<li>wearing armor of order 
<li>reading tract of order
<li>offering peace: +50-200
<li>blessing a monster: +5
<li>let monster flee in wilderness: +100 (lawful only)
<li>hearing the chants of the holy chorus in Dwarftown: +1
<li>successfully using Gardening to plant an herb seed: +5
<li>spending time with lonely NPC: +20
<li>giving gold to monsters: +1-50
</ul><p>

<b>One time lawfull acts</b><p>
<ul>
<li>bringing live Cute Dog to Terinyo: +800
<li>telling the tiny girl her dog died: +600 
<li>saving the carpenter: +1000
<li>killing the Mad Carpenter: +50
<li>killing the Black Druid: +250 if lawful (moves towards neutral if neutral already)
<li>completing Druid quest: +400 if lawful (move towards neutral if already neutral)
<li>completing Village Elder quest: +500
<li>completing Raider Lord quest: +250 if lawful already; towards balance otherwise
<li>killing the Crime Lord: +200-250
<li>killing Kranf Niest: +270 
<li>completing slay random monster quest: +250
<li>completing Ogre Cave quest: +250
<li>saving the dying sage: +5000
<li>telling Blup where mom is: +1000
<li>killing the Greater Black Unicorn (Riurry): +1000 
</ul><p>

<a name="0223"></a><h4>0.2.2.3 Miscellaneous changes</h4>
Upon each alignment change, the following is applied:<p>
<ul>
<li>* 1.2 if negative and Unicorn 
<li>* 0.9 if Tree 
<li>* 0.9 if negative and Book or Wand 
<li>* (51 - PCLevel) * 0.02 if change is positive 
<li>/ 2/4/8 if wearing a C/U/B amulet of balance and neutral 
</ul><p>

All of the above changing alignment are gradual methods which take some time to accomplish an alignment change. 
Without question, the fastest and easiest way to change alignment is by making sacrifices on 
an altar. See the section below about altars for more alignment change strategy.<p>

<a name="023"></a><h4>0.2.3 Altars - how to use altars</h4>
Altars have an alignment score much like the PC, one crucial difference is that the caps are much higher - 
1 million stones in either direction. Initial value appears to be random from -2000 to 2000, making N 
altars twice as common as the other types.<p> 

<a name="0231"></a><h4>0.2.3.1 Status identification</h4>
An altar of a co-aligned deity will reveal the status of any item that is dropped on the altar, i. e. whether they
are blessed, uncursed, or cursed. Dropping items on a non-co-aligned altar will result in an annoyed deity and rats 
being summoned, item destruction might also occur. <p>

<a name="0232"></a><h4>0.2.3.2 Water manipulation</h4>
If your deity is very pleased (see later piety) with you, he or she will bless any potion of water that is dropped 
on the altar, resulting in extremely useful and valuable holy water. Dropping water on non-aligned altar will
result in unholy water, which could be used to curse items, should you ever want this.<p>

<a name="0233"></a><h4>0.2.3.3 Sacrificing</h4>
The main thing you do on altars is sacrificing (or 'O'ffering). Things that can be sacrificed 
include items, food, monsters and gold. When sacrificing items, you stand on top of the altar and 
'O'ffer the item, which will then be accepted or rejected by the deity. When sacrificing 
monsters, you stand away from the altar, wait for the monster to step onto the altar, and then 
'O'ffer it. Note that most humanoid monsters have the ability to speak. This means they can 
sacrifice the PC. Most, but not all, humanoids are chaotic. So idly standing around on an 
altar, especially a chaotic one, near humanoid enemies is a very unwise thing to do.<p>

Priests recieve +50% to all sacrifice values; Paladins +20%. At high levels, sacrifice values are reduced.<p>

<a name="02331"></a><h4>0.2.3.3.1 Sacrificing items</h4>
When sacrificing items, one might want to keep in mind the fact that some races' deities 
specially favor some item types. These can be found in the <a href="adomman-D.html#D2">ADOM Manual</a> and are listed here for
reference. The modifier quantitates a percentage bonus in terms of piety.<p>

<a name="023311"></a><table border=1>

</table><p>

Other observations:<p>
<ul>
<li>Artifacts can be sacrificed and are valuable.
<li>Sacrificing an item or artifact which grants +Curs, +Doom, or CHAOS, gains alignment; 
+5 stones per gp of the item's base value. Beware of this if the PC is close to (pre)crowning. 
<li>Chaos Orbs cannot be sacrificed. Attempting to do so will cause them to reappear on the altar. 
<li>Sacrificing a god gift on the altar of the god who gave it causes -Fate -Luck +Curs +Doom, 
and the PC loses piety equal to twice what it would have gained. 
</ul><p>

<a name="02332"></a><h4>0.2.3.3.2 Sacrificing food</h4>
Food is quite profitable for any race based on its nutrition value, making
blessed stomafilia herbs especially preffered, since they are plentiful resource once 
a living herb pattern is created - refer to section <a href="adomgb-0-13.html#0d6">0.13.6</a>.<p>

Sacrificing food uses a different set of rules from eating it. Start with the base satiation value,
then:<p>
<ul>
<li>blessed: +25%
<li>cursed: -50%
<li>cooked: +100%
<li>Wolf birthsign: +10%
<li>savegame cheating: -95%
</ul><p> 

<a name="02333"></a><h4>0.2.3.3.3 Sacrificing monsters</h4>
Sacrificing monsters can be very bountiful, especially on levels with a high monster generation 
rate. There are a few things to be remembered, though:<p>
<ul>
<li>Lawful and neutral gods don't like it when you sac "their beings", i.e. neutral beings to a 
 neutral god or lawfuls to a lawful god. Chaotics don't care. This
makes the situation simplest for chaotic PCs. They can sacrifice anything on 
chaotic altars with no fear of alignment change. This also means the situation 
is at a dead end: chaotic PC + chaotic altar means no alignment change is 
possible.
<li>Sacrifices of pets, and sacrifices of Druid's animals are always treated as chaotic. 
<li>Bred, summoned, undead, unlife beings and animated trees can not be sacrificed.
<li>Dwarves (other than small dwarf and dwarven chaos knight) cannot be sacrificed in 
Dwarftown, regardless of the altar's alignment.
<li>Priests (Ruun) cannot be sacrificed on any altar anywhere. Merely attempting 
will make them hostile.
<li>No monster can be sacrificed on an elemental temple altars which is still chaotic. 
Orb guardians cannot be sacrificed on elemental temple altars even after conversion.
<li>Sacrificing a monster puts it on the kill list and has all the normal effects 
of killing it. The experience gain from doing this is just 1/20.
<li>Sacrificed monsters drop all carried items, but no fixed drops. Sacrificing 
an orb guardian will therefore make the game unwinnable.
<li>Selecting ratling food (you will not be prompted for an amount) will destroy the 
entire stack and give -200 piety.     
<li>The PC's deity will cure Sickness
with any successful sacrifice if piety is high enough.
</ul><p>

<a name="02334"></a><h4>0.2.3.3.4 Sacrificing gold</h4>
Sacrificing gold is most straightforward and safest. Dwarves profit more from sacrificing gold, as their
deities prefer gold. The topic will be more deeply elaborated later, when discussing conversion.<p>

<a name="0234"></a><h4>0.2.3.4 Converting an altar or PC</h4>
Altars are not simply converted, they experience alignment motion just like the PC. 
Exception: an altar cannot swing from L to C in a single move, or vice versa, if this 
would happen the altar is set to plus or minus 749 (extreme N+/N-) instead.<p>
 
Sacrificing items, food, gold or monsters on an altar can change the alignment of 
the PC or the alignment of the altar. In general, small sacrifices move the 
alignment of the PC towards the alignment of the altar. Note, however, that 
sacrificing at a lawful altar will not move a PCs alignment all the way to L+. 
Likewise, sacrificing at a chaotic altar will not move a PCs alignment all the 
way to C-. To achieve these alignments, the PC has to commit other lawful or 
chaotic acts, respectively (or wear an amulet corresponding to the desired 
alignment, preferably blessed). Large sacrifices move the alignment of the 
altar towards that of the PC. Live sacrifices can fall into either category 
depending on the experience level of the PC and the level of the monster being 
sacrificed. Converting the alignment of a PC or an altar with live sacrifices 
is a somewhat tricky and complicated business and can have dire consequences if 
the sacrificing is done incorrectly. Using gold is much more straightforward. 
To move a PC's alignment towards that of an altar, sacrifice small amounts of 
gold, 10 or 20 pieces, repeatedly. This will eventually result in a message: 
"*WELCOME BELIEVER*" when the PC's alignment changes to that of the altar. 
An additional message, "You feel your morals changing." occurs when changing 
from lawful to neutral on a chaotic altar or from chaotic to neutral on a 
lawful altar. The exception to this easy alignment conversion is the case of 
highly experienced chaotic PCs. More about that special case is found in 
section <a href="adomgb-4.html">4</a>, ultra endings. To change the alignment 
of an altar to match the 
PC's, sacrifice at least 3000 gold at one time. The 3000 figure is a minimum; 
more may be required depending on the PC's experience level.<p>

Some observations about sacrificing on nonaligned altars and changing the 
alignment of altars with live sacrifices: <p>
<ul>
<li>Druids should be very careful to avoid sacrificing animals at any time. 
Sacrificing pets or, for a non-chaotic Druid, animals, is an extremely chaotic act; 
-100 alignment for every xp the monster would ordinarily have given on death. 
Sacrificing an animal as a non-chaotic Druid will set piety to -2000 if it was positive, 
or substract 2000 otherwise. 

<li>If sacrificing on an elemental temple altar and not crowned, all alignment 
changes to the altar are forced to be in the C direction. 

<li>Any time a PC sacrifices at a nonaligned altar, *two* gods are involved: the 
PC's god, who may accept a large enough sacrifice and fight the nonaligned god 
for control of the altar, and the nonaligned god, who may accept small 
sacrifices from the PC and move the PCs alignment towards that of the altar. 
This also means there are two gods who may object to live sacrifices. It is 
always unwise to sacrifice creatures of the PC's alignment or the altar's 
alignment. The exception is chaotic PCs sacrificing at chaotic altars as 
described above.

<li>The fact that two deities are involved when sacrificing on a nonaligned altar 
means a puzzling phenomenon may occur when sacrificing your race's god's 
preferred items on a nonaligned altar. The PC's deity may be able to accept 
the sacrifice and "deeply appreciate" it while simutaneously the nonaligned 
deity is angered by the fact that a nonaligned PC used the altar. Depending on 
the PC's piety relationship with the nonaligned god (it is possible to have a 
piety relationship with more than one god), this may result in a "deeply 
appreciates" message as well as a negative effect such as inventory cursing 
or destruction.

<li>A live sacrifice at a nonaligned altar behaves similarly to non-live sacrifices 
in that small sacrifices move the PC toward the alignment of the altar while 
large ones move the altar to the PC's alignment, but it is much more difficult 
to predict exactly what will happen. There are many factors involved: the PC's 
experience level, crowned vs uncrowned status, piety relationship with both the 
PC's god and the nonaligned god as well as the experience level of the monster 
being sacrificed. A goblin is considered a large sacrifice for a level one PC 
but small for a level ten PC. It is very difficult to predict exactly what will 
happen in borderline cases. After reaching experience level five or so, it 
becomes very risky to attempt an altar conversion using a low level live sacrifice 
such as an orc or goblin. The god's standards are higher than that by this point.

<li>If the PC angers a god by sacrificing one of his creatures, several negative 
consequences may result. For example, if a PC sacrifices a creature of his own 
alignment his god responds with: "*BE WARNED! SACRIFICING MY OWN CREATURES IS NOT 
SOMETHING I WELCOME WITH JOY!*" Repeating this act results in: "*YOU DARE TO 
SACRIFICE ONE OF MY CREATURES?* *DEFILER*" This may be followed by: "-deity- 
luckily seems unconcerned." depending on the PC's piety level. Repeating again 
results in the same two messages followed by conversion of a neutral altar to 
chaotic. This example was done with a neutral PC, exp lvl 5, sacrificing neutrals 
on a neutral altar which became chaotic. The PC did not gain the cursed or doomed 
intrinsics, nor did his alignment change.

<li>A second example: a chaotic PC sacrificing neutral creatures on a neutral altar:
First: "*YOU DARE TO SACRIFICE ONE OF MY CREATURES?* *DEFILER* You suddenly hear 
a thundering voice. *I* hereby punish thee, puny mortal. Your equipment turns to 
dust." Next: "*I* hereby punish thee, puny mortal! You barely notice some 
thoughts: I can't believe it!" The second message here is because the PC was 
wearing artifacts and artifacts only. The PC did not gain the cursed or doomed 
intrinsics. If the PC had been wearing any non-artifact equipment, it would have 
been destroyed. If the PC wore nothing, he gained the doomed, and not the cursed, 
intrinsic.

<li>The implication of the above paragraph should be obvious: Wear ARTIFACTS AND 
ARTIFACTS ONLY when attempting to convert an altar. Wield a si if necessary. 
This completely avoids the equipment destruction and dooming penalties.
</ul><p>

The chart below shows all of the possible combinations for PCs sacrificing 
live monsters on aligned and nonaligned altars. The "altar moves to" field 
*assumes the sacrifice is successful*. A dash means there is no change in the 
altar; these are the "proper" sacrifices a PC makes in order to gain piety 
and move towards the extreme of his alignment. The "god irritated" field is 
as follows: Yes means the PC's god is irritated - a lawful PC tried to 
sacrifice a lawful creature or a neutral PC tried to sacrifice a neutral 
creature. No means the sacrifice was proper, the god accepted the sacrifice, 
the PC gains piety and moves closer to the extreme of his alignment. Fight 
means, it is possible the original god who owned the altar fights, and loses 
every time, to the god taking possession of it. Whether the fight actually occurs
depends on the value of the sacrifice.<p>

How the PC's alignment or piety level changes when converting altars is not
proven for all cases. Note the case of a neutral sacrificing neutrals on a 
neutral altar. It is correct as written. The altar moves to chaotic with no 
(or a very, very small) alignment change or other negative consequences to the 
PC. Also note the remarkable case of neutral PCs sacrificing neutral monsters 
on a chaotic altar. This converts the altar to neutral with no noticeable 
alignment change. Lawfuls sacrificing lawfuls on a lawful altar may convert 
the altar to neutral, but not always. The PC always receives a noticeable 
alignment drop.<p>

This chart will be updated as research progresses.<p>

</table><p>

Note that only champions of Neutrality or Order can convert the altars in the 
elemental temples.<p>

If all of this has confused more than it has helped, here are some rules of 
thumb:<p>
<ol>
<li> DO NOT sacrifice a creature whose alignment is the same as the PC's or 
  the altar's. If you need to take advantage of live sacrifices to increase 
  piety, only sacrifice nonaligned monsters on an aligned altar.
<li>If you must convert an altar, do it with gold. It is much, much safer.
</ol><p>

<b>Summary</b><p>
If the alignment of the sacrifice is different from the alignment of the altar, 
convertions may occur. First, the altar is drawn towards the alignment of the 
sacrifice by an amount proportional to the value of the sacrifice. This effect 
is three times larger for forced chaotic sacrifices. Next, if the altar is now 
still not of PC's alignment, PC's alignment will be shifted; generally 500 
alignment points in the direction of the altar's old alignment; it could be larger 
if a huge sacrifice was made and somehow failed to convert the altar.<p>

If the sacrifice alignment is the same as the altar alignment, PC gains piety. 
The altar's alignment is proportionally drawn towards neutrality or the extremes. 
If the altar is neutral, PC's alignment will be proportionally drawn towards neutrality, 
otherwise no effect on alignment. If the altar does not match PC's alignment 
(this is only possible for forced chaotic sacrifices), alignment will be pulled 
slightly towards the altar.<p>

Effects are applied for PC's piety with the altar's god. If piety with the current god 
is negative, there is a check preventing more than one of the same punishment in a row.<p>

<a name="0235"></a><h4>0.2.3.5 Piety</h4>

Piety level determines your status towards a deity. Three piety levels for three gods
(lawful, neutral, chaotic) are always maintained. They can range arbitrarily, probably wrapping around
integer boundaries.<p>

On any coaligned altar, PC's can detect their items' status by simply dropping the stuff on the
altar regardless of piety level. Furthermore, when any offering has been accepted, you'll 
notice your standing with your deity. The effects are:<p>

For the usual ways of altering piety (prayer and sacrificing) the
two rival deities gain or lose 1/30th the amount of piety (rounded
down) that the aligned deity loses or gains. So pissing off one God
makes the others happy. That doesn't apply to crownings or to any 
of the miscellaneous changes above.<p>

Gold coin gives about 0.32 piety per gold coin, except for
Dwarves who get about 0.48 piety (because their deities likes cash
especially). Or roughly triple (double) the amount of piety needed and
there's your gold cost. Stomafilia herb give 300/240/120 piety depending on
B/U/C status. Other herbs score is negligible: only 5.92/4.8/2.4 per herb,
rounded down. Stomacemptia herbs score the least, a mere 0.32 piety per herb,
regardless of status. Tentatively it looks like live sacrifices
score 448 piety and food scores 120.<p>

Note that creatures cannot be sacrificed in the dark.<p>

<a name="0236"></a><h4>0.2.3.6 Praying</h4>
Praying uses up your piety for an immediate reward, which you however cannot choose, but 
depends on your status and order of precedence - see later. 
It's quite possible to have a prayer
answered and the cost pulls you down to low enough to recieve a
warning, or penalty, but there are some safeguards against this
happening and it's unlikely unless you have been doing a lot of
praying. Here's a funny example:<p>

<pre>You pray to Istaria.
Your cursed broadsword (+1, 1d7+3) glows in a silvery light.
You suddenly hear a thundering voice.
"*I* hereby punish thee, puny mortal!"
Your equipment turns to dust.</pre>

The main safeguard is that you cannot drop more than 3 levels of piety
in answering a prayer if you start off at least "Inner peace". Instead
you will be at the bottom of the level three below where you started
from. For example if you start at 3000 piety and your prayer costs
15000 piety you will end up at -50 piety. That applies to unanswered
prayers too - which also cost piety. I don't know but I don't think it
applies to non-prayer piety penalties but the only one big enough to
matter would be destroying an altar I think...<p>

A second safeguard is that if your prayer is NOT answered and you had
at least "Unconcerned" then, if you drop to one of the low levels, you
will NOT receive a penalty due to low piety (or a warning message)
until the next time you pray.<p>

<a name="02361"></a><h4>0.2.3.6.1 Prices for praying</h4>
In general the cost of a prayer or unanswered prayer is the base cost
multiplied by a factor that increases incredibly fast according to how
many OF THAT KIND OF PRAYER (or how many unanswered prayers) you have
had with that character. The count increases even if you switch
deities. The multiplier is 'triangular n' or n(n+1)/2.<p>

For example the first unanswered prayer costs 20 piety. The second
will cost 60, then 120, 200, 300, 420 and so on. The formula for the
total piety cost of n prayers of the same kind is n(n+1)(2n+1)/6
multiplied by the base cost.<p>

After all that there is a final deduction to the cost of 50% if you are
a champion and Paladins seem to get prayer at 2/3rds cost (not Priests
though), or 1/3rd if crowned. Those do NOT apply to the cost of
pre-post crownings.<p>

In the table below, if not mentioned otherwise, at least 50 piety is required
in addition to the requirement mentioned. In elemental temples, this requirement
is 2 levels higher (3000 piety for standard rewards)<p>

<a name="02362"></a><table border=1><caption>0.2.3.6.2 Praying costs</caption>

</table><p>

[1] The BASE cost of divine mana is between 450 and about 520 depending
upon how starved you are. The cost of 450 is if you have just become
hungry, the cost of 500 is for when you are just about to start
reducing ability levels. Remember to multiply by the triangular n
penalty.<p>

Praying cost is further modified:<p>
<ul>
<li>Pious, Very Pious, and Saint talents *0.95 each
<li>in a room with altar /2
<li>lvl32+ Priest and good standing /2
<li>Candle birthsign *2/3
<li>benevolent room *3/4
<li>malevolent room *2
</ul><p>

<a name="02363"></a><h4>0.2.3.6.3 Order of precedence</h4>
<ul>
<li>urgent heal (health &lt; 25%)
<li>remove sickness
<li>urgent food (satiation &lt; 100 -- ie "Hungry!")
<li>remove cursed / doomed
<li>cure blindness
<li>heal (health &lt; 75%)
<li>remove confused
<li>remove slowed
<li>cure poison
<li>remove mute
<li>remove stunned
<li>food (satiation &lt; 200 -- ie "Hungry")
<li>gain mana (even if you are just 1 pt below max)
<li>remove darkness (diameter = 9)
<li>uncurse an equipped item
</ul><p>

Note that heal and food have two levels of precedence which cost the
same and count as the same prayer. Also I couldn't seem to get cursed 
or doomed removed using prayer if I had both of them at the same
time (by prayer that is - you can do it by sacrificing), so effectively
they have the same precedence. Remove stunning may be 2 places higher
in the list... needs a little more testing. Didn't attempt to find the
precedence of preventing breeding on a level by prayer. Crowning seems
to have the highest precedence, but then it also seems to heal you.<p>

<a name="024"></a><h4>0.2.4 Recovering from errors</h4>
Precautions:<p>

When converting an altar, remove all gear except for artifacts. Also,
remember that the bigger your sacrifice, the more likely it is that the
altar converts - but remember, this sacrifice probably has minimal effect 
on piety, so don't make it ridiculously huge.<p>

Dropping items on a nonaligned altar will make the deity that owns the 
altar angry. This causes some warning messages along the lines of "GET 
YOUR JUNK OFF MY ALTAR." Ordinarily this should be enough warning. If 
an extended drop command is used, however, there seems to be a bug present 
that allows the dropping to continue until the angry deity curses the 
inventory of the PC. Watch out for this.<p>

If things go wrong:<p>
<ol>
<li>Inventory cursed<p>
By the time you have enough valuable stuff to sacrifice, you should be able 
to uncurse a cursed inventory with little trouble. Get to an aligned altar 
immediately. Bless your potions of water by dropping them on the altar if 
you are in sufficient standing with your deity. If not, sacrifice gold 
until you are. Dip a scroll of uncursing into your new holy water, read it, 
and voila, all of your stuff is back to uncursed status. Obviously, 
previously blessed status of inventory items has been lost.
    
<li>Equipment turned to dust<p>
This is why it's always recommended to remove non-artifacts before
converting altars - you don't want to lose those seven league boots or
that nifty sword of sharpness, do you? However, the equipment turned to dust 
penalty can be useful as a last resort for getting rid of a stubborn item. 
Repeatedly praying will anger a deity to this point.
    
<li>Doomed<p>
If the PC had no equipment, dooming rather than equipment turned to dust will 
occur. This is why the PC should have *some* equipment worn, even a si. It 
will be necessary to sacrifice enough to get your piety all the way up to 
very close, at which time the dooming will be removed. It is handy to know how 
to remove dooming and cursing in any case, since these intrinsics can be caused 
by things other than mistakes with altars - robbing shops with lawfuls, attacking 
karmics in melee and pools spring to mind.
    
<li>The worst two - bolt and summoning<p>
Ordinarily these never occur when mistakes with altars are made. It takes 
dooming then repeated additional prayers for a deity to get this mad. However, 
there are two situations where this will happen *immediately* - falling from 
champion status and sacrificing a gift from your deity. The deity casts an 
energy bolt at the PC, which, strangely enough, the PC seems to be immune to 
more often than not. The deity is further incensed by this and says "DAMN, YOU'LL 
SUFFER FOR THIS HUMILIATION TOO!" and summons creatures dependent on the deity: 
lawful deity - solars, neutral deity - holy slayers, chaotic diety - greater daemons. 
The exact sequence of events is dependent upon what the PC is doing, praying 
repeatedly while doomed or falling from champion status. In the former case there 
may be additional monsters summoned prior to those listed above.
</ol><p>

Another case which causes summoning is to get as far as possible from a particular 
god then sacrifice on that god's altar. For instance, if an initially chaotic PC 
sacrifices repeatedly on a neutral altar to achieve very good standing with the 
neutral god then sacrifices on a lawful altar, creatures may be summoned.<p>

<a name="025"></a><h4>0.2.5 Crowning, precrowning and postcrowning</h4>
<a name="0251"></a><h4>0.2.5.1 Requirements</h4>
Crowning itself requires "Extremely close" (30000 piety) and costs
40000 piety but does not reduce you to below 20000 piety. So
effectively the cost is 10000. Very odd behaviour. In practise then
the crowning costs only 10000. Pre or post crownings cost the same.
Although I have listed their base cost as 50000 (meaning that the first
one costs 50000, 2nd costs 150000, then 300000 etc) there are a couple
of oddities. Sometimes (usually) there is a special pre/post crowning
that costs only 10000 piety. The rest use the formula above but all
cost an extra 10000 more than the formula would suggest. However it
looks like you may need to have 20000 piety more than the cost of the
pre/post crowning to get it.<p>

<a name="02511"></a><table border=1>
<caption>(Post)crowning requirements</caption>
<tr><th>Min piety   <th>Cost <th>Crowning
<tr><td>30000  <td>  10000 <td> crowning
<tr><td>30000  <td>  10000 <td> 1st post-crowning (usually)
<tr><td>80000  <td>  60000 <td> 2nd post-crowning
<tr><td>180000  <td>  160000 <td>  3rd post-crowning
<tr><td>330000  <td>  310000 <td>  4th post-crowning
<tr><td>530000  <td>  510000 <td>  5th post-crowning
<tr><td>780000  <td>  760000 <td>  6th post-crowning
<tr><td>1080000 <td>  1060000<td>  7th post-crowning
</table><p>

Pre- and postcrowning gives the PC a random artifact, which will be one of the non-guaranteed
artifacts. The requirements for pre- and postcrowning are:<p>
<ul>
<li> precrowning occurs only if the PC is not of extreme alignment (not L+, N= or C-)
<li> extremely close
<li> character level >= 8 + 3 * artifacts generated.
</ul><p>

Crowning can occur at any experience level.<p>

Postcrowning doesn't include the non-extreme alignment restriction.<p>

Note that PCs who achieve precrowning or crowning may never again see the "extremely close" 
status message. In this case, determining whether the PC has sufficient piety for further 
precrownings, crowning or postcrowning is a matter of trial and error. This is not as bad 
as it might seem, since praying uses up very little piety if prayers "remain unheard" - that 
is, the deity does nothing.<p>

These seem to be the most important requirements in 1.0.0 - for instance, the PC may be 
wearing cursed items and the pre- or postcrowning will still occur.<p>

For crowning, the PC must be at extreme alignment and extremely close (or have enough piety 
at very close). The PC must not be intrinsically Cursed or Doomed for any type of crowning. 
Ordinarily, this will never be a problem, since achieving very close status removes these 
intrinsics. However, if the PC is wearing or wielding an item that causes Cursing or Dooming 
(the Crown of Science, Executor, etc.), crowning will not occur.<p> 

Getting pre- or post-crowned increases the piety required for further pre- or post-crownings.<p>

As an example to show how this works quantitatively, Malte Helmert did <A href="adomgb-0-2-crowning.html">research</A> 
using gold as the sole sacrificial item.<p>

<a name="0252"></a><h4>0.2.5.2 Rewards</h4>
Upon crowning, the PC receives 
an immunity, an artifact crowning gift which is preselected from a list of appropriate items 
for the PC's race and class (see section below), a blessed amulet matching the PC's 
alignment, a permanent blessing, the ability to convert elemental altars for champions of 
Balance and Order, to wear artifacts and other food consumption adding items with less burden 
on metabolism and half praying cost.<p>

<a name="02521"></a><h4>0.2.5.2.1 Immunity</h4>
Note that the immunity received will not be one the PC already has, whether through eating 
appropriate corpses or worn items. For instance, if the PC is wearing the Ring of Immunity 
at crowning time, he will receive no immunity at all - take it off! (as of 1.1.1, it seems 
Ring of Immunity has no effect on immunity granted) 
Likewise, the Ancient 
Mummy Wrapping can be worn or the scorched spear wielded at crowning time to ensure the PC 
does not receive the rather undesirable immunity to cold.<p>

The immunity the PC receives can be figured out by the message that it gives:<p>

<table border=1>
<caption>Immunity messages</caption>
<tr><th>Immunity<th>Message
<tr><td>Acid<td>  "You look forward to be digested by Chaos Lords / Lords of Order themselves."

</table><p>

Note that Dwarves of most classes can receive Hammerhead as a crowning gift (except Dwarven Beastfighters and Monks).
Likewise, High Elves 
and Gray Elves can receive Sun's Messenger as a crowning gift (except Beastfighters).
If appropriate, chance for receiving race-based gift is 12.5%.              
In general, there are six possible gifts. There are exceptions: see 
Barbarian, Beastfighter, Mindcrafter, Paladin, Thief and Wizard.<p>

Andrew Skalski provided the explanation for this. By examining 
the g16p2 executable, he determined that there are indeed less than six possible crowning gifts 
for these classes. However, the blank spots are filled in with a duplicate of one of the 
possibilities. This means that these classes are twice as likely to receive one of the doubled 
possibilities. The updated table above now reflects these observations. The order the artifacts 
are listed in is alphabetical and has no significance.<p>

<a name="026"></a><h4>0.2.6 Piety loss</h4>
As referred to in the <a href="adomman-D.html#D2">ADOM Manual</a>, a PC's piety level is determined by the sacrifices made to the PC's god.
Remember that the value of sacrifices is dependent on a PC's race. Piety level constantly decreases 
with time, so sacrifices made in the early game will have little effect after many game turns have 
passed. In practice, this means that a PC who wants to keep his god happy should sacrifice items 
throughout the game. If a PC wants to be (pre- post- or normally) crowned, he should have a very 
large cache of valuable material to sacrifice. This can include live sacrifices, of course, which 
are always valuable. As stated in the table "Miscellaneous piety changes", the PC loses 1% of piety
every 220 actions.<p>

<a name="027"></a><h4>0.2.7 Tracts</h4>
Tracts are religious books related to particular alignment, weighing somewhat more than regular 
spellbooks. Reading them have the following effects:<p>
<ul>
<li>move PC's alignment to the tract alignment
<li>increase piety for the god of tract, and decrease piety for other two gods (except tract of balance)
<li>tracts of order remove corruption, tracts of chaos grant corruption
</ul><p>

Tracts have finite uses, measured in turns of reading. This is initially set to 1d1000 for a brand new tract. 
Each time you attempt to read a tract, you will spend 20d10 turns reading it, or the remaining time, 
whichever is smaller. While you are reading a tract, your body armor cannot be damaged, and teleportitis is disabled, 
in addition to the normal effects of a long action. If you are interrupted, no further effect will occur.<p> 

In the formulae below, T is the number of turns spent on reading. Piety effects from reading tracts are "raw" piety changes; 
they do not result in the typical -1/30 other god effect. If your piety with some god is reduced to or below -500 by a tract, 
you will suffer negative piety effects (inventory cursing, etc.), unless your god deflects them. Your god will never deflect his 
own penalties, and will deflect the penalties of other gods if and only if your piety with your current god is greater than 1/8 of
the absolute value of the punishing god. Deflection does not cost piety.<p>

<table border=1><caption>Tract effects</caption><tr>
<th>Tract of<th>Corruption <th>Lawful piety <th>Neutral piety <th>Chaotic piety <th>Alignment
<tr><td> order  <td> -T CPs <td> +T/2  <td> -T/2 <td> -T/2 <td> +T/10 
<tr><td> balance<td> No effect    <td> No change  <td> +T   <td>No change  <td> T/10 stones towards N=
<tr><td> chaos  <td> +T CPs <td> -T*2   <td> -T*2 <td> +T*2 <td> -T/10 
</table><p>

Note there is a typo: "You feel the anger of Order brewing" should sometimes read
"You feel the anger of Balance brewing."  The B/U/C status of the tract does not seem 
to have any effect.<p>

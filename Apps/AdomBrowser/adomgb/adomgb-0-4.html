<a name="041"></a><h4>0.4.1 Description and usefulness</h4>
There is an excellent section in the <a href="adomman-E.html#E1">ADOM Manual</a> on skills. Be sure to take
advantage of it. Some additional tips are provided here.<p>

<table border=1><caption>Skills</caption>
<tr><th>Skill<th>Additional remarks
<tr><td>Alchemy <td> One recipe is gained for each ten points in this skill. The last recipe gained
 at skill level 100 is always for potions of gain attributes. The first recipe is for potions of poison for Assassins.
 The keystroke <tt>Shift+r</tt> brings up the recipe list [4]. When the skill level reaches 100, mostly blessed potions are created. 
This is important because of the unpredictable behavior of blessed potions of deafness 
(see <a href="adomgb-app-E.html">Appendix E</a>) [5].
Mixing the wrong ingredients results in an explosion. The diameter is related to the PC's Willpower as usual. Damage is 12d12. This can be exploited. 
Run out of castings of Fire Ball? Wear your red dragon scale mail and apply some wrong Alchemy.
<tr><td>Alertness <td> Very helpful for evading bolt spells and undiscovered traps. Alertness / 600 chance to avoid traps. Small DV increase. [3]
<tr><td>Appraising <td> Not very useful. Cursed items can be rated as good, a nasty surprise.
<tr><td>Archery <td> Obvious benefits. Prerequisite for some nice missile talents. Archers get extra bonus from the skill.
<tr><td>Athletics <td> Nice +8 bonus to speed at 100. Very powerful combination with Raven birthsign.
<tr><td>Backstabbing <td> Very powerful when combined with invisibility or Stealth. +25% chance to criticals. +4 to hit, Assasins lvl 12+ get also +Level to hit.
If successful, damage dealt is doubled, or quadrupled for Assasins and Thieves lvl 12+. Doesn't work on undead. 
<tr><td>Bridge Building<td> If you must build a bridge it is obviously essential. Consider other options though. Gives 5d5 points on initial reading of the manual.
<tr><td>Climbing <td> Manual omits the fact that this must be at 100 to enter the Rift. 
 Training with Yergius makes this much easier to achieve. 'a'pply to exit pits.
<tr><td>Concentration<td> Critical for Wizards and Necromancers. Get this to 100 ASAP - having 100
Concentration is 4 times better than having only 74.
<tr><td>Cooking <td> Improves the nutritious value of corpses and raw meat or fish meat, lowers their
weight slightly, and keeps them from rotting as fast. Useful for preserving the corpse of Orb guardians.
Hurthlings enjoy the added benefit of preferred cooked corpses for sacrificing.
<tr><td>Courage <td> Nice to have, some ignore it entirely when going for an ultra ending.
<tr><td>Detect Item Status <td>Nice but not neccessary.
<tr><td>Detect Traps <td> Very important unless you can recharge wands of trap detection indefinitely.
 There are several heavily trapped areas in the game. Very useful for detecting 
 trapped doors as well. 'A'pply this skill towards any door whose trapped vs 
 untrapped status is unknown. (or just use 's'earch). DetectTraps/200 + DetectTraps chance to find traps per attempt.
<tr><td>Disarm Traps <td>Nowhere near as important as Detect Traps. Once detected, traps are easily 
 avoided. Gives a small amount of experience when applied successfully. This may be the only way to 
 get experience without killing a monster. A skill level of 60 is reliable for door traps. Floor traps 
 require higher skill level. A skill level of 80 is still risky.
<tr><td>Dodge <td>Very nice DV +10 at skill level 100. Factors into dodging bolt spells, though not as much as Alertness does.
Dodge / 200 chance to avoid stone block door traps. Assasins lvl 32+ get double DV bonus, Fighter lvl 12+ get 1,5 DV bonus. 
<tr><td>Find Weakness <td>Very nice increase to critical hits. The skill stacks with weapons which have 
the Critical property (but not Slaying property, which always deliver criticals against vulnerable opponents).
See <a href="adomgb-0-12.html#0c8">0.12.8</a>.
It increases the chance to score critical hits with ordinary missiles such as rocks, coins and arrows.
The chance is a +Find Weakness / 500 in melee, +Find Weakness / 1000 for missile attacks. 
<tr><td>First Aid <td>All PCs have this. Can restore (some) recently lost hit points, but perhaps
 more importantly, can be used every turn to fight sickness. This can be a 
 life saver. First Aid also works for poisoning. Apply the skill every time the 
 game generates the message about "poison coursing through your veins!" There is FirstAid/1.5 % or (To+1)% chance to stop bleeding.
<tr><td>Fletchery <td>Wait until skill level is high, ideally 100, to use it. Logs produce more missiles than sticks. 
Blessed logs give double the number of missiles. Arrows are more abundantly produced than quarrels. There is a small 
chance of producing prefix and suffix missiles.
<tr><td>Food Preservation <td>Important for all, essential for Necromancers. [1]
<tr><td>Gardening <td>Requires herb seeds to train. Using the skill to plant herb seeds is the only way to 
convert a dungeon level that does not support herbs to one that does. Herb farming can increase a low level PCs 
stats quickly and produce endless sacrificial fodder. See sections <a href="adomgb-0-6.html#0613">0.6.1.3<a> and 
<a href="adomgb-0-13.html#0d6">0.13.6</a>. Plant seeds do nothing at all - they don't even train the skill. 
Blessed seeds work better and cursed seeds work worse. 90 skill guarantees planting a blessed seed. Planting successfully gives +5 alignment. 
<tr><td>Gemology <td>Gems are found and some identified solely depending on this skill. 
 Without it, gems will not be found when mining. Exploitable. [2]
<tr><td>Haggling <td>Somewhat useful for all, essential for Merchants. Make sure it is very high
before using it and try to have good Charisma, or a price increase will be the most likely result. Can be used up to 11 times per level.
Price multiplier cannot be lowered below 70%. Effectiveness is very nonlinear; the skill is useless below ~50, and increasing it further 
than ~65 is pointless.
<tr><td>Healing <td>Very important for all PCs. Get it if you aren't born with it.
<tr><td>Herbalism <td>Very useful for all PCs. Willpower, Toughness and Dexterity all go to ~25 
with herbs. All herbs picked without this skill will be cursed. To use the skill, 'A'pply it while
standing on an herb square. The game indicates the health of the plant. Herbs "full of blossoms"
can be safely picked twice; "strong herbs" can be picked once. Picking from a "withered" plant
will likely kill it. See also <a href="adomgb-0-13.html#0d62">0.13.6.2</s>
<tr><td>Law <td>Marginal. By the time this skill informs you of the criminal nature of some act,
 the PC has already committed it! Does inform of lawful acts.
<tr><td>Listening <td>All PCs have this. High skill level may train Perception. Trains naturally,
 don't waste level advances on this.
<tr><td>Literacy <td>Essential for spellcasters, most of whom are born with high levels anyway. 
 Less important than it used to be, since reading scrolls does not require high Literacy. Getting the Weird Tome sets Literacy to 100.
<tr><td>Metallurgy <td>Marginal, even for Weaponsmiths. You should know what metal are your items
made of without ever needing this skill - by weight.
<tr><td>Mining <td>Decreases the time you need to dig through stone with a pickaxe. High level in
Mining prevents pick axes from breaking. [2]
<tr><td>Music <td>Essential for Bards, of course. Very high levels are needed for good effectivity. 
Only monsters flagged as Animals or Aquatic can be affected by music. B/U/C status of an instrument determines 
how far away creatures can be and still be affected: Blessed - 4, Uncursed - 3, Cursed - 2. 
<tr><td>Necromancy <td>Necromancers, of course. Get this to 100 as soon as convenient. Do not 
believe the manual about very slow regeneration of Mana. Using the skill trains the Mana attribute.
All classes can make zombies with the Necromancy skill; Necromancers can make other things as their level progresses. 
On unsuccessful attempt, Necromancy is trained and the PC loses 3d3 PP. 
Successful Necromancy gives -300 Alignment. Only HP and Speed are affected by the type of corpse you use -- 
the Damage, Attacks, DV, and PV are only based on the type of slave you create and its level. 
Some corpses are not eligible for Necromancy. These include the Cat Lord, Yulgash, Nuurag-Vaarn and Filk,
despite the fact that they are all humanoid. The game responds with "The -foo- corpse turns to dust."
The Minotaur Emperor, however is eligible and makes a good slave. 
Corpses should not be blessed when
used for Necromancy. This results in a slave which is critically damaged.
<tr><td>Pick Locks <td>Useful for Thieves. Must have thieves' picks. Both unlocking and locking doors 
is possible. Cannot bypass door traps. It is possible to close and lock a door in one turn by applying Pick Locks. Attempting to 
unlock a trapped door may set it off even on fail, chance (29-Ma) in 30. If trap is not sprung, Mana is trained.
<tr><td>Pick Pockets <td>Useful for all. Only humanoids can be pickpocketed. 'Ignore walls' monsters (Andor Drakon, ghost librarian) cannot be pickpocketed.
Occasionally a truly outstanding object can be pickpocketed. 
 Proving the PC a successful pickpocket allows entrance to the Thieves Guild, a means to receive very
 useful training.
<tr><td>Smithing <td>Useful for all PCs, the specialty of Weaponsmiths. See section
<a href="adomgb-0-14.html#0ed">0.14.13</a>.
<tr><td>Stealth <td>Useful for all PCs. If you're stealthy, monsters will have a harder time seeing
you. Helps in avoiding wilderness encounters. Must be at 100 to get the Weird Tome in Library.
Stealth factors into being able to ambush in the Wilderness. ((Survival + Stealth) / 2) - 1 / 500 are the odds 
of being able to sneak up on the enemies. 
<tr><td>Survival <td>Useful for all PCs, especially Trolls and Rangers. All PCs born in the month of
 the Falcon receive this. Applying the skill while Bloated on a non-water square 
 causes plant seeds to be gathered, which have some nutritional value and can be 
 given to farmers for a small lawful boost. Doing the same on a water square causes 
 fish to be gathered, which can be used to tame a variety of monsters (see section 
 <a href="adomgb-0-11.html#0b13">0.11.1.3</a>). For more quantative info on Survival see
 section <a href="adomgb-1-6.html#163">1.6.3</a>
<tr><td>Swimming <td>Nearly essential for all PCs in later gammas and 1.0.0 that include rivers (at 
 least those without other means of dealing with rivers). Being more burdened, strained etc. makes it harder to swim. 
 Drowning damage depends on MaxHP. Swimming has an energy cost of 1500 at skill 50+ or 1250 below (probably a bug). 
 Wearing an amulet of free action (other sources of the intrinsic do not work) negates this effect. 
<tr><td>Tactics <td>Useful for all PCs, increases modifiers from the Tactics settings.
<tr><td>Two Weapon Combat <td> Useful for all PCs. Two words: Needle. Sting. Best for Rangers. Dual wielding 
is not recommended for early game PCs since it lowers DV (no shield) and doubles attack turn length. [6]
<tr><td>Ventriloquism <td>It is a means of confusing monsters, who will then be hostile after recovering from
the confusion. They do not, however, alert other monsters on the level. This makes the skill extremely useful
against shopkeepers (including the Casino shopkeeper), farmers in Terinyo (for Gaab'Baay's quest) and Thrundarr,
who will wander off his lever when confused. If the skill is not trained to 100, there is a chance the monster
will simply become hostile, but again, it will not alert other monsters. [7]
<tr><td>Woodcraft <td>Marginal. Shortens the time it takes to chop trees.

[1] Food Preservation increases chance of corpse generation
<ul>
<lI>0-59: no change from base chance 
<li>60-89: double chance 
<li>90-100: triple chance 
</ul><p>
[2] Chances of item generation when Mining
<ul>
<li>1/3 chance for rocks
<li>1/300 for huge rock 
<li>1/10 for iron ore
<ul><LI>then 1/20 for mithril ore
 <li>then 1/30 for adamantium ore 
 <li>then 1/40 for eternium ore
</ul>
<li>(1dGemology / ((100 - DL) * 5)) chance for gems
<li> Gemology / 120 chance to ID unknown gems when they're created
<li>1/20 chance of stone giant
<li>1/40 chance for pickaxe to break if not rusty (1/6 if rusty) and you fail a Mining skill check 
</ul><p>
[3] High Alertness provides DV bonuses:
<ul>
<lI>0-74: no bonus
<li>75-100 AND Alchemy: +4 DV
<li>75-90 without Alchemy: +1 DV
<li>91-100 without Alchemy: +2 DV
</ul><p>
[4] Ingredients can be potions and herbs. There are 4 levels of ingredients:
<ol>
<li> Potion of booze, Potion of water, Potion of carrot juice, Burb root, Pepper petal, Demon daisy
<li> Potion of healing, Potion of insight, Potion of troll blood, Potion of oil, Stomafillia herb, Curaria mancox herb
<li> Potion of extra healing, Potion of invisibility, Potion of balance, Potion of cure poison, Potion of wonder, Potion of raw mana
<li> Potion of strength, Potion of youth, Potion of longevity, Potion of ultra healing, Potion of cure corruption, Potion of boost speed
</ol><p>

The available recipes are always for: blindness (1+1), booze (1+1), deafness (1+1), poison (1+2), cure poison (1+3), 
insight (2+2), longevity (2+3), extra healing (3+3), youth (3+4), and gain attributes (4+4). 
The two ingredients are never chosen to be the same item type. A maximum of one herb per recipe is possible.
The order is random except for gain attributes.<p>

[5] Thanks to Krogg and Ascaron for the following observations:
The level of the Alchemy skill seems to have a definite effect on the BUC status 
of the potions produced. Alchemy at 100 when creating potions of blindness, for 
instance, resulted in seven uncursed and 25 blessed. Ascaron tested 100 times 
creating PoGAs. The results were 70/28/2 B/U/C using two uncursed potion 
ingredients and 72/26/2 using two blessed potion ingredients. Using two cursed 
potions gave 66/31/3 results. This is probably within the margin of error for 
a sample of this size. Therefore the BUC status of the potion ingredients 
matters little, if at all.<p>

[6] Calculation of to-hit bonus: start with TwoWeaponCombat * 0.05. From that, 
subtract: ((RightWeaponWeight + LeftWeaponWeight) / 10 [20 if Ranger Level32+, 40 if Ranger Level50]) - 6; 
if this results in a negative number it's changed to 0. Then there's some benefit for all Rangers. 
Add +2 for Ambidextrous talent.<p>

[7] Thanks to CheatMan for the following observations: Attempts to use Ventriloquism on any undead 
always fail. Attempts to use Ventriloquism against constructs may succeed, but they do not react 
to it. Ventriloquism, unlike Mindcraft, works against all insects. Ventriloquism works against 
all orb guardians and Keriax.<p> 
                            
<a name="042"></a><h4>0.4.2 Guaranteed ways of acquiring skills</h4>
The following skills can be taught, or trained by Yrrigs and Yergius, 
providing alignment restrictions are met (see section <a href="adomgb-0-2.html#021">0.2.1</a>).<p>

</table><p>

<a name="043"></a><h4>0.4.3 Non-guaranteed ways of acquiring skills</h4>
Potions and scrolls of education grant knowledge towards a random skill. 11 tries are made to select 
a skill which is not already at 100. The chosen skill is then granted at or increased by 6d5/4d5/2d5, depending on B/U/C. 
Skills can also be wished for; the exceptions are Alertness and Healing.<p>

Potions of training increase the advancement rank of a random skill, by 2/1/-1 B/U/C. It is guaranteed that
a skill not at 4d5 and not at 100 will be chosen if such a skill exists.<p> 

<a name="044"></a><h4>0.4.4 Training skills</h4>
In the sense meant for the sake of the following table, "training" means actions that will cause a skill to 
spontaneously increase, *without* the player deciding to increase skill proficiency when gaining an experience 
level. This is different from Yergius' training, which can change the potential maximum for a skill (how high 
the PC can raise it) and the dice roll (how fast the PC can get it there). The value of Yergius' training can
only be taken advantage of when gaining an experience level or after successfully applying the skill elsewhere 
in the game.<p>

</table><p>

[1] Giving hatchets to the Carpenter gives a direct, immediate boost to the Bridge Building skill, or even grants the skill at 1dLe+1d10+8.<p>
[2] Smithing is most easily trained by removing rust from items; you can rust items on purpose
by hopping in a river or water trap, and removing rust doesn't use any ingots.<p>
[3] The training for Pick Pockets goes up only when
it's applied successfully (you steal something or get the "nothing of
value" message). The training goes up 3 points if something is stolen,
and 4 if the "nothing of value" message comes up instead. <p>

<a name="045"></a><h4>0.4.5 Class aptitudes</h4>
Each class has different proficiencies at skills, reflected in the initial advancement scheme (section <a href="adomgb-0-1.html#01412">0.1.4.1</a>)
and in the advancement rank. 
Take, for instance, a Fighter's Courage skill. This is in the 3d3 (rank 5) column, so, at 45 skill his Courage will be advancable by [+3d3] at a time. 
If it is less than 40, the advancement dice will be 3d4 (rank 6), if it is 50 or more, then advancement dice will be only 2d4 (rank 4). Advancement dice moves 
one column for every multiple of 10 crossed. However, the advancement dice will never go below the rank-specific minimum, in this case 1d3 (rank 2).<p>

Typefaces are used to indicate skill relevance. Bold skills are guaranteed to the class; italic ones are easily available 
(race, or in some cases random chance), and plain ones can only be obtained in game.<p>

<a name="046"></a><h4>0.4.6 Skill mechanics</h4>
<b>Skill checks</b><p>
When your skill value controls your chances of success at something, it's called a skill check. Every skill check in ADOM has a difficulty class, 
typically on the order of 120. A die with the difficulty class sides is rolled. If it comes up maximum, there is automatic failure; 
otherwise, you succeed if your skill value is at least as high as the rolled number (so rolling 1 means automatic success).<p> 

For some skills (in the manual marked with '+'), the die may be rolled multiple times - twice at 80+ skill, three times at 100. The lowest (best for you) 
result is taken. Note that this nearly eliminates the automatic failure chance.<p> 

The Stealthy and Mechanically Inclined talents reduce difficulty class by 10%. E.g. if you would be comparing Stealth or Disarm Traps against 1d400, 
compare it against 1d360 instead.<p> 

Successful skill checks give 1 + floor(Le / 20) points of active training (see below). Note the discontinuity at Le values divisible by 20.<p> 

<b>Variables associated with skills</b><p>
There are 3 semi-hidden variables associated with each skill:<p>
<ol> 
<li>First is your skill advancement rank. This corresponds loosely to your increase dice, however, it extends in both directions. 
You could have an advancement rank of one rank beyond 4d5 (this is rank 10) - this would result in 4d5, but the next time your dice decreases, 
it would stay 4d5 (but now rank 9). Skill advancement automatically decreases by one rank each time your skill value crosses a multiple of 10.

<li>Second and third are the training counters. The two training counters, taken together, determine the amount by which you can raise your 
skill; if both are zero or the sum is negative, you cannot increase a skill until it has been somehow trained. The counters, here 
called 'active training' and 'inactive training', are equivalent except that only active training can lead to increases over time. 
When a skill is increased, voluntarily at level up or over time, the training counters are decreased, taking first from active and then from inactive.
</ol><p>

<b>Training Over Time</b><p>
This is what happens every turn when the game checks to see if skills get trained up:<p> 
<ol>
<li>A SkillTrainCountdown value is decreased by 1. If it's then not 0, nothing happens. 
<li>If SkillTrainCountdown = 0, then (130 - Learning) * 5 + 1d100 = SkillTrainCountdown. (The higher your Learning is, the more often you have a chance 
to get a skill increase. At 25 Learning you'll be roughly 575 turns between checks; At 15, you'll be at about 625 turns.) 
<li>For each skill, If 1d(SkillPoints + 10) > SkillPoints, proceed. 
<li>If Skill can advance (has material, has positive active training, not rank 0, not already at 100), add to skill based on 
advancement rank OR 1d(active training), whichever is less (and it won't raise over 100 obviously). 
<li>Training is then reduced (active first, as always)
</ol><p> 

<b>Increasing Skills at Level ups</b><p>
Skill increases after level 50, henceforth known as fake levels, follow slightly different rules. Take the difference between your level 49 and 
your level 50 experience requirements. You can gain a fake level if and only if you have gained that much experience since your last levelup 
(real or fake), and you have at least one advancable skill. (This is why skill uses tend to precipitate fake levels.)<p> 

On real levels only, you have a chance to increase your skill advancement rank. The chance of it happening is 
(total training) in 1000 for each skill. Improvement cannot occur if you are already at 100, or already have 4d5 or better dice advancement, 
or are lacking skill increase materials if applicable. If it does occur, a message is only generated if the visible dice changes; increasing 
from one rank to another is hidden if both dice modifiers for the ranks are below or at the minimum.<p> 

After this, on real levels, some permanent training is awarded. Your advancement rank dice is rolled twice; the greater roll is divided by 2 and 
added as inactive training.<p>

For the duration of a single levelup (real or fake), some temporary training is made available, equal to (for each skill) your advancement rank dice, 
rolled twice taking the larger, divided by 2, and adding a 1d4-1. This temporary training is lost after the level increase whether it is used or not; 
this can lead to your training going negative. The increase is always added to active training.<p>
 
You can increase a number of skills starting at 3 and increasing by 1 for every 5 Le after 10. Bards receive two bonus increases. Level 6+ Bards receive 
an additional bonus increase. Characters born under the sign of the Book, or those under Cup if the (new) level is even, receive an additional increase.<p>
 
After removing temporary training, training is decayed, reducing active training to 3/4 of its prior value and inactive training to 7/8. Note that training 
will never decay if you do not gain levels.<p>

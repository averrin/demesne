<caption>0.1.1 Day and date effects</caption>
<th>Starting a game on...<th>results in the message...<th>and has the following effects...
<tr><td>Creator's Day (TB's birthday, July 2nd)
<td>You feel that starting your adventure on Creator's Day was a good idea.
<td>PC starts with Lucky and Fate smiles; also, if the day falls on a Monday, HP are not reduced.
<tr><td>Christmas Eve (December 24th)<td>A lone star leads you to this remote valley.
<td>PC starts with Fate smiles.
<tr><td>New Year's Eve (December 31st)
<td>You feel well prepared for the coming year.
<td>PC starts with six blessed potions of booze.
<tr><td>Any Friday the 13th
<td>You feel unlucky.
<td>PC starts Cursed.
<tr><td>Any Monday
<td>You feel slightly exhausted today.
<td>PC starts slightly low on HP.
</table><p>

There are of course Ancardian day and date effects as well, which are well covered in the <a href="adomman-B.html#B1">ADOM Manual</a>.
One Ancardian time effect not mentioned is the fact that the PC's range of sight depends on the time of day in wilderness squares.
In the morning (which apparently begins at 6h), the PC sees further, and in the evening (which apparently begins at 22h) the PC's
sight is limited to 2 squares. The Farsight spell seems to negate this.<p>

<a name="012"></a><h4>0.1.2 Birth </h4>
<a name="0121"></a><h4>0.1.2.1 Star sign</h4>
Game related effects of different star signs are well covered in the <a href="adomman-B.html#B2">ADOM Manual</a>.
Unfortunately you normaly don't get to choose the star sign for your character. Please refer to
section <a href="adomgb-1-1.html">1.1</a> for discussion of what character is good for each
starsign.<p>

<a name="0122"></a><h4>0.1.2.2 Special birth messages</h4>
If you are really lucky, one of these messages could be generated along with the star sign.<p> 

<ul>
<li>The night you were born....<br>
...the local undead were seen packing up and moving away.<br>
It means that your character will gain (or is born with?) the "natural
enemy of undead" intrinsic. This makes undead flee from you periodically.
This also means you always slay undead - same effect as !Unde weapons.<p>
    
<li>...your long lost brother showed up.<br>
Greater chance of special locations generated in dungeons (hives, shops,
pools, etc.)<p>
    
<li>...a two headed calf was born.<br>
10% less experience points are required for an experience level increase.<p>
    
<li>...a falling star killed the village elder.<br>
10% less experience points are required for an experience level increase.
</ul><p>

<a name="013"></a><h4>0.1.3 Sex</h4>
The sex of the character has little significance. The following table lists 
all known gameplay differences. <p>

<table border=1><caption>Gender differences</caption>
<tr><th>Condition <th> Male <th> Female <th> More info
<tr><td>Start with <td> +1 St <td> +1 Dx <td> &nbsp;
<tr><td>Shop prices depend on <td> Ch <td> Ap <td> &nbsp;
<tr><td>Wedding ring works for banshee <td> Yes <td> No <td> <a href="adomgb-2-17.html">2.17</a>
<tr><td>Wedding ring tames <td> berserkers <td> female berserkers <td> <a href="adomgb-0-11.html#0b13">0.11.1.3</a>
<tr><td>Frog quest is available <td> No <td> Yes <td> <a href="adomgb-app-K.html">Appendix K</a>
<tr><td>Cheaper keys <td> No <td> Yes <td> <a href="adomgb-1-3.html#134">1.3.4</a>
<tr><td>Base Smithing cost <td> 5000 gp <td> 5250 gp <td> <a href="adomgb-0-14.html#0ed">0.13.14</a>
</table><p> 

<!-- Besides from slight starting attribute modifications (+1 St vs. +1 Dx),
it is a wedding ring, which protects only male PC's from Banshee wail (more on this in 
<a href="adomgb-2-17.html">2.17</a>), and the frog quest, which is available only to female characters
(see <a href="adomgb-app-K.html">Appendix K</a> for details). Also, Appearance is used when interacting 
with NPC's of opposite gender, while Charisma is used when interacting with NPC's of the same gender, and 
when interacting with animals. Since most important NPC's are male - particularly shopkeepers, who offer
prices according to female's Appearance/male's Charisma, it could be concluded that Appearance has 
little more significance for females and Charisma for males.<p> -->

<a name="014"></a><h4>0.1.4 Race and class</h4>
A list of the races and classes can be found in the <a href="adomman-C.html">ADOM Manual</a>. It also gives a bit of background about each,
much of which is flavor and irrelevant in terms of gameplay.<p>

<a name="0141"></a><h4>0.1.4.1 Specific starting trained skills and alignment</h4>
Each race has unique characteristics including initial alignment, trained skills and modifiers to attributes. 
Skills in ADOM vary in terms of availability. All PCs are born with Climbing [1dDx + 1d10 + 20], First Aid [1dLe + 1d10 + 15],
Haggling [1dCh + 1d10 + 15], and Listening [1dPe + 1d10 + 20].
All PCs other than Beastfighters and Barbarians with a Learning score of 10 or greater are born with Literacy [Le*4]. 
Many skills can be taught or trained by various NPCs during the game. Other skills are much more difficult 
to obtain if the PC is not born with them. Skills other than Alertness and Healing can be wished for.
Any skill can be obtained from a potion of education, but this is a matter of random chance and cannot be counted 
on. Skills available only from wishes or potions of education are referred to as "Nonguaranteed Skills" for the 
sake of the tables below. The first table shows the starting alignment and trained skills [starting value] that each race is born
with. For all starting values, please consider 1dx as 1dx-1, ie generating a random number between 0 and x-1. 
So 1d5+5 means a value between 5 and 9. Consider ydx (y > 1) normally.<p>

<a name="01411"></a><table border=1>
<caption>Race-specific starting alignment and trained skills</caption>

</table><p>

Lawful alignment is +2000, neutral is 0, and chaotic -2000. This is then modified by class: Druids have alignment 
set to 0, Necromancers get -1500 and Healers get +1000.<p>

[1] Bards never get: Necromancy, Bridge Building, Tactics, Law, Courage. Every other skill (except Music) has 25% chance, with starting value of [1d20 + 15]<p>
[2] if specializing on potions, then Alchemy [1dLe], else if specializing on scrolls then Literacy [1d20 + 30] else (wands or rings) Survival [1d20 + 20]<p>

Falcon birthsign increases Survival by 10, or grants Survival at 10 if there was no Survival by race or class.<p>

<a name="01413"></a>
The manual also states that Bards get more skills than other classes. Testing does not agree with this.
What the manual fails to mention is the two free skill advances per level Bards receive. This is useful
for races that have low initial Learning scores, such as Orcs and Trolls.<p>

There are definite effects on gameplay depending on the alignment, skills and birthsign the PC is born with. 
Note that none of the races is born with the Healing skill; it is entirely class-dependent. Nine classes are
born with Healing. It is essential to obtain this skill. This means that those without it *must* choose
Rynt's quest as opposed to Guth'Alak's in Terinyo, whether they intend to actually obtain the skill from Jharod 
or Kranf Niest. This puts restrictions on the game right away, since the Keethrax quest and thus a guaranteed
artifact and potion of cure corruption are forfeited before the game even starts. Further, three races start with
chaotic alignment. If the PC wants to receive Healing from Jharod, thus avoiding Kranf Niest's stat drains,
alignment must be changed to neutral (or lawful).<p>

Note also that no race starts with Herbalism, the other skill available through a Terinyo quest. If the player
wants maximum flexibility - to do either Rynt's or Guth'Alak's quest, or neither (in the case of a minimalist 
challenge game) - choose a class that starts with Healing, Herbalism, or ideally both, such as a Beastfighter, 
Druid, Healer, Priest, Ranger or Wizard.<p>

If there is a skill that is difficult to obtain that you cannot live without, such as Alertness, play a Dark Elf 
or Drakeling, or choose a class that is born with it - Archers, Healers, Monks, Rangers and Thieves all start with 
this skill. Many players feel similarly about Detect Item Status - play Priests or a Merchant for a challenge.<p>

A PC that trains a given skill due to both race and class will be especially proficient with that skill. This 
makes certain combinations especially powerful. Dwarven Weaponsmiths (doubly trained Metallurgy and Smithing),
Hurthling Archers (doubly trained Archery), Hurthling Farmers (doubly trained Archery, Cooking, Food Preservation, 
Gardening, Stealth) and Dark Elven Rangers (doubly trained Alertness and Climbing) are examples.<p>

<a name="0142"></a><h4>0.1.4.2 Class powers</h4>
The <a href="adomman-C.html#C3">ADOM Manual</a> contains a list of the classes along with their characteristics and class powers.

[1] can be ANY skill, and does not have the restrictions imposed on character creation. Bards gain Random(20) + 20 in those skills.<p>
[2] stolen items must have at least 10 value<p>
[3] Trains St by (Level*5)-155)*4, Dx by (Level*5)-155), and To by ((Level*3)-93)*10<p> 
[4] Shadow Touch will regain HP first; if maxed, it will regain PP instead. PP Gained is DamageDealt / 2, HP Gained is DamageDealt / 3. 
There is DamageDealt/1000 chance to get +1 Mana.
If 1d10000-1 &lt; damage dealt, you gain 1 Mana<p>
[5] also receives only 1/3 of drowning damage<p>
[6] melting ability is determined by the weight of what you're melting down as far as how many ingots you'll get. This means for example ultra-heavy armors 
are especially nice for melting down. 
Blessed hammer + blessed metal = 9:1000 (9 ingots for 1000 stones); B+U = 8,1:1000; B+C = 6,3:1000; U+U = 7,2:1000; U+C = 5,6:1000; C+C = 4,4:1000.
Failing a Smithing roll halves the amount you get.<p>
[7] if monster level&lt;50 and monster not unique: (50-moblevel)*2 / 1000 chance for instant kill<p>
[8] if monster not unique, and (monster is humanoid but not undead/construct), and 
(monster size &lt; 3 or Monk level &gt;= 40): (50-moblevel)*2 / 1000 chance for insta-kill<p>

<a name="01433"></a>Higher Xp number means more experience is required to advance a level.<p>
<!--- Note on the Xp column. It represents how hard is a particular race/class to advance levels. Basically, multiply 
the two numbers to get a Xp ratio. For Cup borns (and some starting messages), multiply again with 0.9. There are
few exceptions to this rule however:
Troll Farmers and Troll Merchants have Xp ratio of 3, and Orc Priests have 1.4.
Xp ratio of 1 means the PC will require about 150 xp to advance to lvl 2. It varies depending on starting attributes,
lower attributes mean lower lvl 2 requirement, so weaker PC's have somewhat easier time when advancing levels. 
Multiply 150 with Xp ratio to get approximated level 2 xp requirement. For higher levels, multiply the xp needed
for previous level by x, where x gradually decreases from 1.9 to 1.0666.<p>--->

The <a href="adomman-C.html#C2">ADOM Manual</a> gives some hints about race/class combinations. For instance, the manual identifies Trolls
as the strongest, toughest and stupidest race in the game and suggests that they make good fighters (because 
of their Strength and Toughness) and lousy magicians (because of their low Learning and Mana). This is true
as far as it goes, but Trollish Wizards can be a viable combination if they are played more as fighters to
start and later develop their magical talents. Elves make fantastic Wizards (due to their high Learning and
Mana) once they gain some experience, but are difficult to keep alive in the early game because of their low
Toughness. Humans are a jack of all trades race and can be used with all classes. Some combinations favored
by newsgroup readers:<p>

<b>Trollish Beastfighters and Barbarians</b> - brute force fighters<br>
<b>Gnomish Elementalists</b> - magic users with more Toughness than elves<br>
<b>Elven Archers</b> - natural talent with bows<br>
<b>Elven Wizards</b> - high Mana and Learning<br>
<b>Dwarven Weaponsmiths</b> - natural smithing talent<br>
<b>Hurthling Archers</b> - natural talent with thrown rocks<p>

Classes and combinations that are regarded as difficult:<p>

<b>Farmers</b><br>
<b>Merchants</b>, especially Dark Elven Merchants because of their low Charisma and Toughness<br>
<b>Necromancers</b> in general are very difficult to keep alive at low levels<p>

</table><p>

<a name="0145"></a><h4>0.1.4.5 Special considerations</h4>
<b>Dark Elves</b> - Dark Elves receive very low offers and high prices in Waldenbrook's Dwarftown shop. Dark Elven
Necromancers are very Chaotic. It takes some work to get them to Neutral alignment to receive Healing from Jharod, 
for instance, if that is desired. Dark Elves are unique in that spider corpses are nutritious for them. Poison
resistance can still be gained from spider corpses.<p>

<b>Drakelings</b> - Drakelings face special problems in the ToEF (see section <a href="adomgb-2-19.html">2.19</a>)
 and D: 49 (see section <a href="adomgb-3-12.html">3.12</a>). 
Drakelings who are unlucky enough to find a greater white dragon vault will also face speed problems. Drakelings
have a unique racial acid spit, which does Max(2,Level/3)d6+(Level/2) damage, has Max(2, St/4) range, hits
target if 1d(Level+10)+Dx > MonstersDV+3, and consumes 5d10+50 food points per spit.<p>

<b>Hurthlings</b> - Hurthlings start the game with the Thrown Rocks missile weapon skill at level four. They also 
start the game wearing a cursed ring, unfortunately. Hurthlings also have a racial dislike for shoes, which causes
a loss of dexterity when Hurthlings use footwear in ADOM. Hurthlings also have an advantage over other races when 
training the slings and thrown rocks missile weapon skills: they require only two thirds of the marks other races 
do in order to advance a skill level.<p>

<b>Gnomes</b> - Gnomes require only 3/4 the number of missile weapon marks to advance their crossbow skill level 
relative to other races.<p>

<b>Elves</b> - All elves, High, Gray, or Dark, have very long lifespans. This is worth considering since several
of the high level monsters encountered in ADOM have an aging attack. Ghost Lords, for instance, may well age a
Human or Troll to death in one or two hits, since these PCs have a life span of 100 years or so at most.
Elven PCs do not need to worry about this, since they live for about 1000 years. Balancing this is
the fact that they are more fragile than other races in terms of Toughness in the early game.<p>

<b>Orcs</b> - Like Dark Elves, Orcs receive very low offers and high prices in Waldenbrook's Dwarftown shop.
Orcs have a short lifespan relative to other races.<p>

<b>Trolls</b> - Trolls advance in experience level very slowly relative to other races. Trolls start the game
with the Twohanded Weapons melee skill at level two. Do not pay any attention to this if you are playing a trollish
Beastfighter. Drop that club and fight unarmed.<p>

<b>Bards</b> - Bards have an advantage when using Music; their chances for taming/calming down monsters is higher 
than other classes.<p> 

<b>Druids</b> - All Druids start at neutral zero alignment, and get spellbook of Lightning Bolt. Non-summoned
animals are neutral towards Druids (including cats). Bugs in the bug-infested temple are not included.<p>

<b>Wizards</b> - Wizards born under the Salamander birthsign always start with spellbook of Fire Bolt. Wizards
have easier time writing scrolls.<p>

<b>Merchants</b> - Merchants always specialize in a certain item: potions, rings, scrolls, or wands. This specialization
allows them to identify any item in that category on sight. Merchants have the ability to use thrown gold pieces as
effective missiles. Dopplegangers are not able to deflect gold pieces thrown by Merchants. This is the only known way
to attack dopplegangers with missiles. Merchants also receive better shop prices, the exception is Terinyo shop.<p>

<b>Necromancers</b> - The manual states that level 50 Necromancers can return from the dead if their Toughness is greater
than 10. It goes on to say that they lose one-half of their Toughness when this happens. It does not mention that if their
equipment keeps their Toughness at 10 or more, they can do this indefinitely. Necromancers suffer from low dice modifiers on
their skills, finding difficulties to advance Concentration, limited by a 1d3 or 1d5 modifier. Of equal importance for
Necromancers is Food Preservation, similarly limited. In contrast, Rangers, Bards and Beastfighters can expect very high
4d5 modifiers on most of their skills.<p>

<b>Farmers</b> - Farmers start the game with a large dog pet, level two in Polearms weapon skill and require 20% less marks
to increase their Polearms level.<p>

<b>Mindcrafters</b> - Mindcrafters possess really unique Mindcraft abilities no other class can ever obtain. The <tt>Ctrl+I</tt> 
command is used to invoke Mindcraft. More on the Mindcraft abilities in section <a href="adomgb-0-5.html#053">0.5.3</a>.<p>

<b>Weaponsmiths</b> - Your PC can never start out burdened - Strength will be raised enough so that the PC can handle the weight. 
Weaponsmiths start with a very heavy 1000s anvil; this can give weaker races, like Hurthlings, a large, free Strength boost.
Weaponsmiths of course have easier time Smithing - see section <a href="adomgb-0-14.html#0ed">0.14.13</a> for details.<p> 

<b>Beastfighters</b> and <b>Monks</b> increase their Speed, DV, to-hit and damage with level.
Beastfighters lose their bonuses if using weapons. Monks get no bonuses if Burdened or worse, wearing a shield,
or an armor other than robe, black robe, clean robe, clothes, elven chain mail, Shirt of the Saints, Robes of Resistance.
The Speed bonus for both classes is lvl/2, to-hit bonus is lvl*2 + lvl/3 - (lvl-1)/5 - 1.
Beastfighter's damage is 1d(4+lvl/3*2) + lvl/2+lvl/4, Monk's damage is 1d(8+lvl) + lvl/4. Beastfighters get +1 DV every
third level, Monks get +1 DV in two levels out of three. Also, Monks do not lose Mana when writing scrolls.<p>

Of course, you can choose the PC's name freely, and you can also rename the PC later using the 'n'ame command.
You may as well let the game select a name for the PC, if you just press Enter to the game prompt, but only if 
Allow_Default_Names is set to true, that is. Otherwise you are required to enter a name! 
The monster memory remembers PC's name and provides verbal descriptions of his/her current experience 
level, attributes except Perception, and DV/PV values.<p>

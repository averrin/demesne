<a name="B1"><h3>The Horoscope</h3>
The sky of Ancardia is covered by a myriad of stars.  One moon circles
the world.  The inhabitants of Ancardia believe in the magical forces
controlling the movements of the celestial bodies.  Magic energies
influence one's life depending on the time of birth.<p>

Each month is named after a particular star sign.  One year has 12
months, each with four weeks of seven days each.  In addition, there
are two special days in each month which don't belong to any week.
The first day in a month is Darknight, when no moon is visible.  The
16th day of a month is called Silvernight, when the moon shines
brightly.  Darknight is considered to be a dangerous day followed by a
night filled with evil magics.  In contrast, Silvernight is a joyful
day (when nobody usually works) and is followed by a night full of
feasts and revelries.<p>

During the day of Darknight all evil magics are very strong while good
magics are severely hampered.  On the day of Silvernight good magics
enjoy great advantages while evil magics are severely hindered.  The
weeks are named Oneweek, Twoweek, Threeweek and Fourweek.  Thus a
typical month is structured like this:<p>

<table border=1>
<tr><th>Day         <th>Specific Name
<tr><td>1           <td>Darknight
<tr><td>2- 8        <td>Oneweek
<tr><td>9-15        <td>Twoweek
<tr><td>16          <td>Silvernight
<tr><td>17-23       <td>Threeweek
<tr><td>24-30       <td>Fourweek
</table><p>

The following twelve star signs are used to name the months:<p>

When the game is started, a star sign is determined (together with
your character's birthday). The star sign has some effects on the
career of the character.  Note that some signs are quite variable in
the attributes they govern. Your character will also be slightly
favored during the month named after his star sign.  Finally,
characters tend to be very lucky on their birthday.  You might want to
consider these factors when creating a character.<p>

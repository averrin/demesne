<a name="03"></a><h3>Food</h3>
<a name="031"></a><h4>0.3.1 Preventing starvation</h4>
Starvation is often a definite problem for new players. Rest assured that there is 
enough food provided in the game to survive. The easiest source at the start of the 
game is Munxip's food store in Terinyo. He sells primarily large rations, which are 
heavy at 200 stones each. These can be useful for training the Strength of PCs that 
start with low Strength. Food will be found in the various dungeons available from 
quests assigned in Terinyo, and in all dungeons, for that matter. If the PC elects 
to take Tywat Pare's quest to find and kill Kranach and his gang in the wilderness, 
remember that wilderness square are big, take considerable game time to cross, and 
therefore require much more food per game turn than exploring in the dungeons.<p>

Once the PC finishes the area around Terinyo, he will have to cross a large area of 
wilderness to reach the Caverns of Chaos, the main dungeon in the game. The same 
warning about food requirements in the wilderness applies. After reaching the Caverns 
of Chaos, a short descent to the Arena level will provide a very good food source. 
Ratling traders are found on this level, selling various comestibles. The best are 
cooked lizards. These are light at 3 stones each, fairly inexpensive and nutritious. 
Food problems are generally solved at this point.<p>

Most of the corpses that monsters leave are edible. Some are to be avoided. Kobolds 
of any type cause sickness. Rats (simple rats, not giant rats) will make any race 
other than Trolls or Orcs vomit, but still increase satiation level slightly. Eating 
humanoid corpses, such as goblins, causes the message "This meal does not sit well with 
you." or "You feel uneasy." to be displayed. Several players have tested eating a 
variety of humanoid corpses while wearing the Platinum Girdle, which kills if a chaotic 
act is committed. It never killed the PCs.<p>

Having said that, PC's who have trained the Law skill will receive the message "You 
feel as if transgressing some law." when eating a humanoid corpse, even a lowly goblin. 
However, there is no effect on alignment. This seems to imply that there is a bug 
somewhere in the humanoid corpse-eating code. Bear in mind that Thomas himself has stated
that eating humanoid corpses is not a chaotic act.<p> 
<ul>
<li>Dwarves refuse to eat dwarven corpses. They also refuse to eat orc corpses unless they 
are starving.
<li>Hurthlings refuse to eat black hurthling corpses.
<li>Races other than Trolls refuse to eat doppleganger corpses unless starving.
</ul><p>

Be aware that some food items are susceptible to rotting. These include corpses of all 
types, apples and pieces of raw meat. Eating rotten food does not cause 
sickness or other negative effects. Food that starts to rot has actually become cursed 
and will soon disappear. Eat it quickly if possible. In the case of corpses, especially 
strategically important ones such as chaos creatures or quicklings, rotting may be 
indefinitely stopped by repeatedly dipping the corpse in holy water when necessary, thus 
blessing it. Cooked corpses decay more slowly than uncooked corpses. Cooked corpses can 
be created with the Cooking skill or by blasting them with fire, from the fire bolt spell, 
for instance. Blessed cooked corpses carried by PCs with Food Preservation at 100 decay 
at the slowest rate. This is very handy for preserving the corpses of Chaos 
Orb guardians (section <a href="adomgb-0-10.html#0a311">0.10.3.1.1</a>).<p>

Wearing certain items causes a need for increased food consumption. This includes all 
items that grant invisibility, artifacts (especially for PC's that are not crowned) and 
worst of all (since they grant no positive effect) amulets of hunger. Interestingly, 
intrinsics, including intrinsic invisibility, do not have any effect on food consumption. 
Likewise, the Fate smiles / Lucky / Cursed / Doomed intrinsics have no effect.<p>

The level of satiation is displayed on the screen. High levels of satiation 
(satiated or bloated) will cause a speed decrease.<p>

One type of herb, stomafillia, is extremely filling. Blessed stomafillia will cause 
a PC to be bloated immediately.<p>

The satiation value of food items is increased by 25% for blessed items and decreased by
50% for cursed items.<p>
<ul>
<li>Trolls have food consumption doubled.<br>
<li>Monks have food consumption halved.<br>
<li>Farmers have food consumption halved starting from level 12.<p>
</ul><p>

<a name="032"></a><h4>0.3.2 Satiation levels</h4>
Thanks to Malte Helmert for working out all details of this chapter.<p>

Most "base" PCs use one unit of nutrition each turn. The units of nutrition
for the various food items are listed below. None of the following applies
to food consumption in the big wilderness map, where different rules apply
(maybe just a multiplier). Apart from equipment, the formula for a PC's food 
consumption per turn is as follows:<p>

<table border="1">
<tr><td> 1 <td>standard
<tr><td>+1 <td>for Trolls
<tr><td>+1 <td>when Strained or Strained!
<tr><td>+2 <td>when Overburdened!
</table><p>

The total value after those modifiers is halved for Farmers of Level 12+
and Monks of any level. So, for example, an overburdened Human Fighter
would consume 3 units per turn, and a Strained! Troll Monk would consume
1.5 units per turn. In this case, fractions are *not* rounded away: The
character will alternate between consuming 1 and 2 units.<p>

After that, additional modifiers apply, which are *not* halved for Monks
or Farmers:<p>

<table border="1">
<tr><td>+3 <td>for each (!) equipped item granting Invisibility
<tr><td>+0.5 <td>for each equipped artifact (rounded down), for uncrowned or fallen
 champion PCs
<tr><td>+0.25 <td>for each equipped artifact (rounded down), for crowned PCs
<tr><td>+15 <td>in the wilderness, for non-Trolls
<tr><td>+30 <td>in the wilderness, for Trolls
</table><p>

Food consumption in the wilderness is independent of movement speed, including seven 
league boots, and terrain type.<p>

So, for example, a strained Troll Barbarian, crowned chaotic, wearing 7
artifacts and one item granting Invisibility will consume 7 units per turn
(1 standard, 1 troll, 1 strained, 7/4 rounded down = 1 for the artifacts,
3 for the invisibility).<p>

From all experiments conducted with WADOMF and g16pre2, there was no
influence caused by:<p>
<ul>
<li>alignment (some suggested that only champions of law get the artifact
 discount, but it is identical for chaotics and presumably
 neutrals)
<li>being a fallen champion (that is, there is no special penalty - it's
 just like not being crowned)
<li>any corruption (the suspicious mana battery and corrupted
 tissue corruptions were tested)
<li>any intrinsic (particularly, intrinsic invisibility does not increase
 food consumption - this was very surprising; likewise,
 the Doomed/Cursed/Lucky/Fate Smile makes no
 difference)
<li>the Invisibility spell
<li>being a Healer or being born in the month of Candle
<li>HP or PP regeneration rate, having eaten Troll corpses, having drunk
 potions of troll blood or raw mana, wielding regenerating items - the
 last is very surprising
</ul><p>

The different satiation categories are:<p>

<table border="1"><caption>Satiation</caption>
<tr><th>Satiation level<th>Satiation display
<tr><td>2501+ <td>Bloated
<tr><td>1501..2500 <td>Satiated
<tr><td>200..1500 <td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>100..199 <td>Hungry
<tr><td>50..99 <td>Hungry!
<tr><td>0..49 <td><font color="red">Starving</font>
</table><p>

A character with satiation level 0 has a random chance of dying because
of starvation each turn. In g16p2 and later versions, apparently no food
consumption takes place while eating, so it should be impossible to starve
to death while eating (unlike previous versions).<p>

Note also that starvation does not kill until Strength has dropped to half
of what it was when the Starving message is shown. There is a -4 drop on
getting to Starving status. From there Strength and other stats will continue
to drop until Strength reaches 50% of its value when Starving status was reached.
(Thanks to johonka for this info on Starving)<p>

Some other observations:<p>
<ul>
<li>It is possible to wish for "satiation" or "food". This sets the satiation
level to 5000 if it was below this value. It does nothing otherwise.
<li>Scrolls of satiation add 2000/1000/0 to the satiation level
if blessed/uncursed/cursed.
<li>Apart from corpses, the only food items that can be cooked are raw meat
and fish meat, as noted in the table. Unlike corpses, they can only be
cooked with the cooking skill; fire destroys them.
<li>From preliminary testing, it seems that apples and pieces of raw meat rot
at approximately the same rate.
<li>Stomafillia herbs are different in that their B/U/C status is more
influential than for other food items: They yield 6250/2000/550 points of
satiation depending on whether they are blessed, uncursed or cursed.
<li>Stomacemptia herbs are the only non-corpse food items that lower the
satiation level. Even bad ratling food, despite yielding the "you vomit"
message, satiates slightly. Stomacemptia herbs do not apply a fixed
modifier but behave a bit differently:
<br>If the character is not yet starving, the new satiation level is set to a
fixed value depending on the B/U/C status of the herb (rows) and the old
satiation value (columns):
<p><table border="1">
<tr><th>Status <th>50..99 <th>100..199 <th>200..1500 <th>1501+
<tr><td>blessed <td>49 <td>99 <td>199 <td>1500
<tr><td>uncursed <td>49 <td>49 <td>99 <td>199
<tr><td>cursed <td>49 <td>49 <td>49 <td>49
</table><p>
Put in words, blessed herbs always set the satiation level to the highest
possible value of the next lower category (from satiated to normal, from
normal to hungry, from hungry to very hungry, from very hungry to
starving), uncursed herbs go two such steps, and cursed herbs always go
down to starving.
<br>If the character is already starving (satiation value 0..49), then the
satiation value is decreased by 20, but not below 0, irrespective of B/U/C
status of the herb.
</ul><p>

<a name="033"></a><h4>0.3.3 Eating corpses</h4>
In addition to <a href="adomgb-app-J.html">Appendix J</a>, this section lists corpse effect in greater detail.<p>

<a name="0331"></a><b>How to read the list</b><p>
<ul>
<li>Only corpses with effects are listed. 
<li>Colons (:) symbolize conditions; basically read as 'if (thing before the colon) is true, then (do stuff after colon). 
This is often a percentage chance, but it can be other things as well. Conditions can stack (meaning multiple things have to be true).
<li>Stat increases (or decreases) listed by themselves (Such as '+1 Pe') without parentheses mean you ALWAYS gain that stat when eating 
the corpse (provided any conditions are true).
<li>Stat increases listed in parentheses (like '(+1 St)') have a chance to gain that stat, depending on your current amount in that stat. 
There is a chart that shows your chance to gain. 
<li>Speed increases are all done the same way. I listed them in parentheses because they are also harder to gain the higher it is. 
(There is a speed chart as well).
<li>Commas (,) seperate gains/checks. You gain (or have a chance to gain if there are conditions) everything in the list that's seperated with a comma.
<li>Semicolons (;) denote mutually exclusive checks. This means you can only get 1 possibility out of the series... I try to use square brackets 
to make it more obvious what is in a series.
<li>Poison effects have 2 numbers (unlike other status effects) - the first is how much (Da)mage the poison does and the second is how often 
((Fr)equency) that it happens.
<li>Most bad effects will stack on top of others. If you're confused already, and you eat something which confuses you, that amount is added 
to how many turns you'll stay confused.
<li>'Trains' means that it trains the stat, so that you have a chance to gain it over time (like being burdened trains Strength).
<li>Exclamation points (!) simply mean 'not'.
<li>Curly brackets at the end of some of the checks are to make it plain and obvious what is the highest level of the stat that can be reached 
by eating the corpse in question. This should make it a little easier to understand for anyone who doesn't understand the 'code-like' parts.
<li>"Spellcasting monster" means "[Cursed: 5%: +2d3PP; Uncursed: 25%: +2d3PP; Blessed: 50%: +2d3PP], 16.7%: +1 Ma".
<li>"Bad luck" means lose Lucky and Fate smiles intrinsics if present, and gain Cursed and Doomed intrinsics.
<li>"Karmic" means it will get the PC somewhat more Luck: if Doomed, then lose Doomed, if not then lose Cursed, 
if neither Doomed nor Cursed then gain Lucky, if already have Lucky then gain Fate smiles.
<li>The PC is not sickened eating a rabid dog corpse if wearing necklace of rabies resistance.
<li>MaxAge is never reduced below CurrentAge.
<li>Level 40+ Assassins cannot be poisoned.
</ul><p>

<a name="0332"></a><b>Examples</b><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Kobold Shaman</b>: +1 Ma, [Cursed: 5%: +2d3PP; Uncursed: 25%: +2d3PP; Blessed: 50%: +2d3PP], Sickens 20d8
<p>Kobold Shamans always give you +1 Mana when eaten, then there is a 5/25/50 percent chance (depending on the
 C/U/B status) of gaining 2d3 (average 4) Power points. Then you become sick; you basically lose 1 sickness point
 every 20 turns so 20d8 * 20 is how many turns you'll be sick for unassisted.<p>
<li><b>Chaos Viper</b>: (+1 Dx), -Pois, (+1 Sp), Poisons 8d5Da_3d3Fr, Corrupts 10d200
<p>First, you have a chance to gain 1 Dx depending on what your Dx is already at. Second, you always
 gain poison resistance. After that you have a chance to gain 1 speed, then you're heavily poisoned 
 (on average it will start out dealing 24 damage every 6 turns, though the fact that it gives poison
 resistance may weaken the effect instantly). Finally, it corrupts you for an average of 1005 CP which
 is about 1 corruption worth.<p>
<li><b>Ghul</b>: ![-Para]: Paralyzes 2d8
<p>This one is pretty simple. If you are paralyzation resistant, nothing special happens. 
 Otherwise, you're paralyzed for 2d8 turns.<p>
<li><b>Ettin</b>: [St &lt; 8]: 62.5%: (+1 St); [St &lt; 16]: 60%: (+1 St); [St &lt; 20]: 58.3%: (+1 St); [St &lt; 24]: 16.7%: (+1 St); 
[St = 24]: 14.3%: (+1 St)] {St up to 25}
<p>Whooo boy. Thomas sure made the giant-folk complicated, didn't he? The code doesn't actually look like
 this, but this was the simplest (believe it or not) way I found to display the effect. Notice that the 
 curly brackets at the end give you the big picture: They can raise your strength up to 25, no higher. 
 Every check has a chance to raise your strength depending on what it already is, and the higher it is the less 
 chance you have to raise it. Note also that the stat increases are in parentheses so the actual chance to raise
 from 24 to 25 is a mere 8%.

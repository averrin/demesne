the Control-key and the key 'x' at the same time to invoke the
corresponding command.<p>

</table><p>

For details about the dynamic display see the end of this section.<p>

In the game you will encounter multiple screens containing tables,
lists, etc.  Whenever you are given the choice to get out of one of
those screens by pressing the 'Z' key, you can also press the space
bar.  The 'Z' key is always listed in the help lines because of
historical reasons (and because it's easier to display than the ' '
;-)<p>

It is possible to redefine the keybindings (see the appropriate
section of the manual for details).<p>

<a name="O2"></a><h3>Movement</h3>
You can move into eight directions by pressing the respective number key
displayed in the following movement grid:<p>
<pre>
                             7  8  9
                               \|/
                             4 -5- 6
                               /|\
                             1  2  3
</pre>
To attack a monster, simply try to move into the field the monster is
standing on.  This will result in a melee attack.<p>

If you opt for faster movement you can activate the so-called
'walk-mode' by pressing 'w' followed by a direction key.  This will
make your character walk into the chosen direction until he meets
something of interest.  Movement will cease as soon as one of the
following things happens:<p>

<ul>
<li>         Your direction of choice is blocked.
<li>         A monster appears in your immediate vicinity.
<li>         Items are lying at your current position.
<li>         Something special (e.g. a stairway) is located at your current position.
<li>         A move will bring you into the immediate vicinity of a monster.
<li>         You are stunned, confused or blinded.
<li>         Your hunger status changes.
<li>         You are bleeding, sick or poisoned.
</ul><p>

Generally, activating 'walk-mode' is a good way to cover long distances
which have been explored before.  To make full use of the vast array
of available tactical options, you should not use 'walk-mode' when
exploring unknown locations.<p>

Walk-mode also allows the character to wait in place (e.g. to
regenerate lost hitpoints or power points).  Just press 'w' for
walk-mode and the '5' for waiting in place.  Walk-mode will abort if
a monster enters your immediate vicinity, your equipment weight or
your hunger level changes or 50 turns have gone by.<p>

If you are using the numeric keypad remember to press NUM LOCK.<p>

<a name="O3"></a><h3>Speed</h3>
Actions in real life rarely are synchronous.  Beings rather act
individually, move with different speed and are either slower or
faster than others.  ADOM simulates this by using a 'speed system'.
The core notion of this system is that every character and monster has
to collect a certain amount of energy to be able to act.  Some beings
are able to gather this energy faster and thus can act at higher
speed, others gain this energy more slowly and thus act in a slower
way.<p>
        To be able to act once in ADOM your character needs to
accumulate at least 1000 energy points.  Every acting being has a
'speed rating' (SR) and a current energy rating (CER).  ADOM divides
each player turn into a number of segments.  In each segment every
being on the current level adds its speed rating to its current
energy.  Each being that passes the '1000 energy minimum' with its
current energy rating is allowed to act.  Afterwards the CER is
reduced by 1000 (in most cases).<p>
        All Player Characters start with a basic speed rating of 100
which basically means that they can act once every 10 segments.  This
rating can be modified by class (monks and beastfighters get faster
with more experience), dexterity (a score of 17 or higher can be
helpful), encumbrance level (the more you are encumbered the slower
you get), alcohol level (being drunk is not a good idea in all cases),
satiation level (a full stomach makes you move slower... starving
doesn't help either), your Athletics skill, and special items.  Being
born under the sign of the Raven also helps.<p>
        Your energy can never be lower than 1 (although this spells
certain doom) and is not limited by any value.  The only limit is that
you can act only once per segment (even speed scores of 2000+ can't
help in this respect... although they are impossible to attain in any
case).<p>
        Most monsters also have a base speed rating of 100, although
there are exceptions.  Be prepared to face changing speed
monstrosities occasionally.<p>
        Finally you need to understand that some items don't increase
your overall speed score but might limit the energy costs for certain
actions (e.g. seven league boots could require you to expend but 500
energy points to be able to move -- thus you could move faster, but all
other actions would be carried out at normal speed).
This is also true for weapon skills which are able to reduce the
amount of energy required to stage an attack (see the section on
weapon skills for details).<p>

SPECIAL NOTE: If you are setting your tactics level to 'coward' and
then simply move around without attacking anything, such a move only
costs 800 energy points *if* your hitpoints are reduced to one-third
their starting value or below (panic does that to you -- and since
ADOM basically is a heroic game we'll ignore other wound effects).
Remember this when you try to run away!<p>

<a name="O4"></a><h3>The Dynamic Display</h3>
The dynamic display is used to present detailed information about the
actions of the player.  It either can display the current turn number
(an internal game counter), the current speed rating of the display or
the energy cost of the last action of the player character.  Usually
the current speed rating is displayed.<p>

Note that the 'energy cost for the last action' display option does not
necessarily show the expected value for energy costs below 1000.
This is so because ADOM's internal rating system for action costs
relies on relative measurements (e.g. if your potion of speed results
in an 800 energy point cost for movement and due to your class you
also would be able to move for 800 energy points, this is scaled to a
cost of 100000 / {100 + [(100000 / 800) - 100] * 2} = 666 energy
points).  If you don't understand the formula, simply look at the
source code. ;-) Not understanding it is *not* a sign of being stupid
;-))<p>

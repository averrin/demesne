During game play everything you encounter is represented by certain
symbols on the map.  Symbols are simple colored characters. Some
symbols have more than one meaning.  This section explains the various
symbols and their potential meanings.<p>

distinguish them.  The following scheme is used (with some

<a name="N2"></a><h3>The Player Character Screen</h3>
ADOM provides a screen with most of the important statistics you might
want to know about your PC.  Usually (as per default command set) this
screen is invoked by pressing '@'. The PC screen is divided into several
parts dedicated to certain aspects of the PC.<p>

The upper left half of the screen is dedicated to the attribute scores
of your PC.  It lists all the attribute names in the first column (in
yellow, if not yet maxed out or in brown if maxed out in the natural
way), followed by the current unmodified attribute score.  The next
column lists the natural maximums for the attribute scores.  They can
be raised by long and hard training, but usually only magic will be of
quick help when trying to pass these limits.  (See the section on
attributes for more details.)  The next column displays temporary
attribute bonuses (e.g. from certain potions), followed by a column
listing special bonuses (e.g. due to magical items).  The last column
shows the total score for each attribute.  If your attribute score is
raised, it will be displayed in green; if it's lowered by some means,
it will be displayed in red; if it's equal to the maximum score
possible, it will be displayed in brown.  In all other cases yellow is
used.<p>

The upper right half of the screen contains a list of miscellaneous
data.  First you'll see the current speed rating.  If you also enjoy a
temporary speed bonus, it will be displayed in square brackets.  This
is followed by a verbal approximation of that rating.  Then the screen
lists your current financial status, potential debts, the name of your
deity, and the elapsed amount of game time.  The next entries are
concerned with your omens of birth and star sign.  First you'll see
the number of the day on which you were born in the Ancardian year
followed by your star sign.  Then you'll see the *current* month in
the game (both by number and by name).  The next line describes the
*current* day in the game, both by its number in the current month
and by its absolute number in the current game year (so that you can
compare it to your birthday).  Finally, the state of the moon (full,
new, waxing, waning) will be described.  The last entry in that
section displays the age of your character.<p>

In the middle of the screen you'll see the encumbrance data for your
PC.  In order, you'll see the current encumbrance, the minimum encumbrance
to be considered burdened and the respective minimum levels for being
considered strained and very strained.<p>

Below this, you'll see the data for melee combat, kicking, and missile
combat.<p>

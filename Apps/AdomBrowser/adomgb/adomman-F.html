<a name="F1"></a><h3>Talents</h3>
Each character in ADOM has one or more talents representing inborn
strengths and abilities that favour the character in some special
way. A character receives one or more talents at the time of character
creation (depending on several factors, among them race, profession,
star signs and special luck) and also steadily gain new talents while
advancing in level: every third level a new talent is gained.<p>

While talents sometimes are independent of each other, at other times
they depend on prerequisites. These prerequisites can be highly
variable: race, profession, attribute scores, level, skills and other
things are possible.<p>

By selecting talents in a special order, you will be able to focus on
certain key areas and thus gain access to very powerful yet highly
specialized talents. By remaining unfocused you can choose from a wide
variety of talents and thus remain flexible.<p>

If no talents are available (because you don't meet the
prerequisites), your choices are lost.<p>

<a name="F2"></a><h3>Initial Talents</h3>
The initial number of talents is determined according to the following
rules:<p>

<ul>
<li>Every character receives one base talent.
<li>Characters born under the sign of Falcon or Candle receive one
  free talent.
<li>Characters with a Mana score of 18 or more receive one free
  talent.
<li>Gnomes and hurthlings receive one free talent.
<li>Bards, merchants and farmers receive one free talent.
<li>Characters whose sum of attributes is divisable by 7 receive one
  free talent (this represents some inborn magical luck or talent).
</ul><p>

<a name="F3"></a><h3>Cumulative Talents</h3>
All talent effects are cumulative, e.g. they add up or multiply
(depending on the special effect in question).<p>

<a name="F4"></a><h3>Talent List</h3>
The following list of talents is sorted in alphabetical order and
gives each talent with a brief description and optionally a list of

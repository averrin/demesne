<a name="07"></a><h3>Weapon skills</h3>
A general description of weapon skills can be found in the <a href="adomman-G.html#G1">ADOM Manual</a>.<p>

In general, a PC with higher Strength will do more damage with a given 
weapon. There seems to be one important exception to this: whips. As 
implemented in ADOM, the damage done with whips, especially dual-wielded 
whips, seems to be more dependent on Dexterity than Strength. The manual 
touches on this subject, stating that a PC must have high speed to use two 
whips effectively. Dexterity seems to be at least as important.<p>

<a name="071"></a><h4>0.7.1 Jack of all trades or master of one?</h4>
This is a matter of personal preference and style. The advantage of becoming 
very proficient with one weapon becomes clear from reading the manual: bonuses 
to the to-hit and to-damage as well as reduced attack cost when using the weapon. 
There is also the possibility of achieving Grand Mastery, where the attack cost 
is reduced to the point where about 1 1/2 attacks per round is possible. The 
downside is also easy to imagine: without an artifact weapon in the specialized 
category, a PC can have the weapon destroyed and be without one. In practice 
this is not usually a problem since there are generally plenty of weapons to be 
found in the game. Also, a PC may run across a truly outstanding weapon at some 
point in the game, some of which are guaranteed, and have no skill with the 
weapon. Again, this is not usually a huge problem since mid- to high-level PC's 
will be able to train up their weapon skill in any given category relatively 
quickly.<p>

Critical hits yield double skill marks. If the PC finds a weapon that delivers critical hits,
it will train about twice as fast. Throwing shield yields shield skill marks. No skill marks
are gained if fighting using Very Defensice or Coward tactic setting. No shield marks 
are gained on Berserk. <p>

<a name="072"></a><h4>0.7.2 Class considerations - what weapon to specialize in</h4>
<b>Beastfighters</b> - Beastfighters receive severe penalties for using melee weapons, 
and should avoid doing so for this reason. They develop a formidable unarmed 
attack as they advance in experience and Unarmed Combat skill. Note that the 
penalty does not apply to missile weapons; all beastfighters should practice 
with missile weapons in order to take advantage of -foo- slaying ammunition.<p>

<b>Mindcrafters</b> - Willpower is critical for Mindcrafters. The Sword of Nonnak is a 
guaranteed artifact sword available to most PCs at experience level 15 or less. 
It grants +5 to Willpower. This makes Swords an attractive weapon class for 
Mindcrafters to specialize in, at least during the early game.<p>

<b>Monks</b> - Monks also receive penalties for using weapons, albeit not as severe as 
Beastfighters, and so should specialize in Unarmed Combat. Monks also excel at 
kicking and receive a class power that enables them to deliver a circular kick.<p>

<a name="073"></a><h4>0.7.3 Achieving Grand Mastery</h4><p>
Grand Mastery is difficult to achieve. It will not happen simply from using a 
single weapon type throughout a normal game. Becoming doomed in the wilderness 
for the frequent wilderness encounters is one way of generating an infinite 
number of enemies to be killed with no corruption. The Crown of Science (doubly 
useful because of its +9 bonus to Le) or a ring of doom can be used for this.<p>

There is one class + starsign combination that can reasonably expect to achieve 
Grand Mastery during a normal game. Note the following two manual entries:<p>

From the Weapon Skills section:<p>

<b>Farmers</b> are so skilled in the use of polearms that 
they need 20% less marks to increase in their use.<p>

From the Horoscope section:<p>

<b>Sword</b>
Positive modifiers from Tactics settings are increased by 10%, costs to increase 
melee weapon skills are reduced by 20%, +1 to the initial Learning score.<p>

This double 20% reduction in cost to increase weapon skills means that Farmers 
born in the month of the Sword who use polearms exclusively, and do not hurry,
can expect to achieve Grand Mastery with polearms. This will happen 
approximately by the time the PC reaches the Mana Temple, depending on the 
ending the PC is going for, etc.<p>

<a name="074"></a><h4>0.7.4 True Berserker</h4>
Any PC except Monks, who wield a weapon without armor (Beastfighter is no exception), and 
switch tactic to Berserk, get a True Berserker bonus, which is +10 to hit and 
damage, in addition to Berserk tactic setting bonus. Shields, Necklaces, Rings, 
Bracers, Tools, Missiles, Missile weapons and Armor with "of rage" suffix can 
be worn and the PC is still a True 
Berserker. If the requirements for true berserking are met, every melee attack 
will yield the "You lust for blood!" message before hits or misses are displayed.
Also, the message "Do you really want to attack..."  will not be displayed and the
PC will instantly attack any monster, hostile or not.<p>

<a name="075"></a><h4>0.7.5 Melee combat</h4>
<b>To hit</b><p>
Stunned gives -4, Blind -4, Bloated -2, Satiated -1, Drunk -1, Blessed +2, Spear without shield +2,
Invisible +4, Dwarven Shield and Dwarven Rune Axe paired +10 (axe must be in left hand), Needle and Sting +50.
Furthermore there is bonus based on Strength: +(St-12)/2, +(St-9)/2, only positive bonus is applied.
Melee Weapon Master talent gives +3, Basher, Powerful Striker, Mighty Strike give +1, +2, +3 if weapon 
weight>=100s, Brawler +2 if unarmed. Monks and Beastfighters get additional bonuses if unarmed (see
<a href="adomgb-0-1.html#0145">0.1.4.5</a> for details).<p>

An enraged monster has twice as many attacks as it normally would, and has 3 less DV.<p>

<b>To damage</b><p>
Torch +1d4 and additional +2d4 vs fire vulnerable, thorns corruption +3d3, Assassin or Thief lvl 12+ and backstab *2,
of the sun suffix vs undead *2, ashen vs undead =0, hateful weapon and Berserk tactic +2d6, Barbarian's mighty blow *2,
tremendous blow *3, deadly and chilling silence room *10, vibrate with life room /10, 
blessed weapon vs undead and demons *1.5, cursed /2, rusty weapon /2, broken weapon /2, 
meleeing with a missile weapon /2,
lawful weapon vs chaotics +1d8, chaotic weapon vs lawfuls +1d8,
critical blow *1d4+1, slaying *1d4+2, mild weapon /5, penetration weapon +monster PV.<p>

<a name="076"></a><h4>0.7.6 Missile combat</h4>
<b>To hit</b><p>
Blind -4, Stunned -4, Confused -4, Drunk -3, Satiated or Bloated -1, Burdened or worse -1, 
Blessed +2, Invisible +2, 
Archer +lvl+6, Paladin, Thief, Barbarian, Fighter +lvl/2, Assassin, Bard, Ranger +lvl/3,
other classes +Lvl/4,
Merchant throwing gold +Lvl-1, Good Shot, Keen Shot, Eagle Eye talents +1, +2, +3,
+Max((Dx-12)/2,0), +Max((Dx-9)/2,0), stuck in webs /2, shifting breeze room /3, 
+Concentration/50, +Archery skill bonus (read manual).<p>

<b>To damage</b><p>
Merchants throwing gold get Level/2 + 3 more damage.<p>

<a name="077"></a><h4>0.7.7 Critical hit chances</h4>
Base chance is 5%, but Luck modifies this slightly. Murderous weapon doubles this chance. Then add the following:
<ul>
<li>+(FindWeakness/5)% if melee attack
<li>+(FindWeakness/10)% if missile attack
<li>+25% if backstabbing
<li>+10% for lvl 25+ Fighters
<li>+20% for lvl 25+ Assassins
<li>+((lvl+10)/1.2) % for Beastfighter vs animal (+10% at level 2, +50% at level 50)
<li>+50% bloody dagger, +50% whip of slaughtering, +40% axe of minotaur emperor, +30% Serpent's Bite, +0% Grod (bug)
</ul><p>

Due to a bug, ring of the master cat (+16%) and bracers of war (+8%) increase critical chance 
only if used as melee weapons.<p>

<a name="Q1"></a><h3>The Inventory</h3>
Every PC normally carries quite a number of items -- some of them
belong to the initial equipment, others are found during the
adventure.<p>

All items worn or equipped are displayed upon pressing the 'i'
key.  If you want to change your equipment (either by wearing an
additional item or by removing an item currently used) you simply need
to press the letter preceding the body part in question.  If an item
was equipped, it will automatically be removed.  If no item was used
you will automatically be shown a list with items which might be
useful on that body part.<p>

Items normally have to be identified by some means to get more than
just some general information.  Some items are identified by using
them (e.g. weapons and armor), others have to be identified by magical
means.  When identified, every item might list a number of values
which further describe the powers of the item.<p>

Armor must be worn to have any effect.  Weapons must be wielded to
have any effect.  Rings, bracers, and necklaces must be worn to be useful.<p>

Items are generally rated as uncursed, cursed or blessed.  Cursed
items cannot be removed when worn and mostly do not function with full
effect.  They also are susceptible to damage more often.  Blessed
items are of very high quality and might exert some additional powers.
They are more difficult to damage.  Uncursed items represent average
items.<p>

Items also might be broken or rusty.  There might be means available
to repair or improve such items... try to find out about this for
yourself.<p>

In the following section, items are listed by category with all
possible modifiers.  The following abbreviations are used to describe
the modifiers:<p>

<ul>
<li>CHA - Number of charges remaining
<li>DAM - Damage dice (given in the dice notation explained above)
<li>DVM - DV modifier
<li>MDM - Missile damage modifier
<li>MEM - Melee attack modifier
<li>MIM - Missile attack modifier
<li>PVM - PV modifier
<li>ATM - Modifier to a specific attribute
</ul><p>

The following item descriptions are available.  First the item type is
listed, then the possible modifiers follow.  Not all modifiers always
appear, this depends on the specific item.  The kind of visible
modifiers can be determined by the type of brackets surrounding them:<p>

<ul>
<li>&lt;bracers&gt; [DVM, PVM]
<li>&lt;shield&gt; (MEM) [DVM, PVM]
<li>&lt;armor&gt; (MEM, MIM) [DVM, PVM]
<li>&lt;gauntlets&gt; (MEM, MIM) [DVM, PVM]
<li>&lt;cloak&gt; (MEM, MIM) [DVM, PVM]
<li>&lt;girdle&gt; (MEM, MIM) [DVM, PVM]
<li>&lt;helmet&gt; (MEM, MIM) [DVM, PVM]
<li>&lt;boots&gt; (MEM, MIM) [DVM, PVM]
<li>&lt;wand&gt; (CHA)
<li>&lt;melee weapon&gt; (MEM, DAM) [DVM, PVM]
<li>&lt;missile weapon&gt; (MIM, MDM) [DVM, PVM]
<li>&lt;missile&gt; (MIM, DAM)
</ul><p>

Any item (in theory) can be followed by {ATM}, which means that the
item in question grants the specified bonus to the mentioned
attribute. Any weapon can be followed by (p), which means that the
item is poisoned.<p>

Finally, the number of charges for wands will only be visible if you
zapped that specific wand successfully or identified that specific
wand.  In other words: if you identify 'tin wands' as 'wands of magic
missiles', you still won't know the number of charges of a newly found
'wand of magic missiles' (although it will be correctly identified in
all other respects).<p>

<a name="Q2"></a><h3>Filtering the Stuff List</h3>
Beside those items you carry directly on your body (which can be
viewed by pressing 'i'), you also have a backpack which might contain
large numbers of items (directly viewable by pressing 'I').  At times
you need to retrieve an item from that backpack and this can be a very
tiring process if you are carrying a large number of items.
Therefore ADOM contains a mechanism to filter the list of items in the
backpack, so that only certain item types are displayed and it's
easier to find the item you are looking for.<p>

Whenever it is possible to apply a filter to the items in your
backpack, the last line of the screen will display the current filter
and the possible commands to select a certain item type.  In all cases
(except for '#' -- which stands for all items), you can select a
certain category of items by pressing the symbol which usually
represents those items. The following keys are used to filter the
items in the backpack:<p>

<table border=1>
<tr><th>Key       <th>    Meaning
<tr><td><tt>[</tt><td>    all wearable items
<tr><td><tt>&</tt><td>    all amulets and tools
<tr><td><tt>,</tt><td>    all bracers*
<tr><td><tt>(</tt><td>    all melee weapons
<tr><td><tt>}</tt><td>    all missile weapons
<tr><td><tt>/</tt><td>    all missiles
<tr><td><tt>{</tt><td>    all musical instruments
<tr><td><tt>=</tt><td>    all rings
<tr><td><tt>\</tt><td>    all wands
<tr><td><tt>!</tt><td>    all potions
<tr><td><tt>?</tt><td>    all scrolls
<tr><td><tt>"</tt><td>    all books
<tr><td><tt>%</tt><td>    all food
<tr><td><tt>$</tt><td>    gold
<tr><td><tt>*</tt><td>    all gems
</table>
* this is an exception to the 'image rule' since some
   systems wait for a second key to be pressed after the '~' used for
   bracers and this would make this feature somewhat tiresome to use).<p>

<a name="Q3"></a><h3>Beasts of Burden</h3>
While many players seem to enjoy carrying around heaps of stuff, this
is not really recommended.  If your PC carries a lot of stuff, he'll
get hungrier soon.  This in turn means that you probably will have to
carry more food, which can get damaged and further burdens you.  ADOM
uses several burden levels (from burdened over strained to very
strained and overburdened) to mirror this fact.  Each burden level
comes with a growing need for food.  Take care!<p>

<a name="C1"></a><h3>The Player Character</h3>
To be able to fight Chaos, you will have to create a fictional
character, often called the player character (or PC).  This character
will be chosen from one of the intelligent races of Ancardia, will
undergo long and hard hours of training to learn a profession and many
skills enhancing his chance to defeat evil and finally save the world.<p>

All these concepts are explained in detail in the sections below.<p>

<a name="C2"></a><h3>The Races</h3>
In ADOM, a wide variety of fantasy races can be chosen for your player
character.  Each race has certain advantages and disadvantages and
receives different equipment and attributes.  Each race also gains
some default skills as their cultural heritage (see the section on
skills for a complete list of available skills in the game). You
can choose among the following races:<p>

<h4>HUMAN</h4> Humans are the most generic of all races.  They tend to be
adaptable, suited for every profession and generally well equipped.
They are also very fast learners.  While humans do not have any other
special advantages, they don't suffer from any disadvantages either.<p>

Humans train in the following skills: Climbing, Food Preservation,
Haggling, and Swimming.

<h4>TROLL</h4> Trolls are extremely huge and strong creatures with large
muscles, pointy teeth, big horns and a lot of hair all over their
body.  They are nearly always in a bad mood.  Most races shun them
because of this.  Trolls are by far the strongest and the dumbest race
available in this game.  They make excellent fighters and lousy
magicians.  Trolls are somewhat disadvantaged by their great size
(good targets!) and the great amounts of food they need to sustain
their bulk.  They also learn very slowly and need a lot of experience
points to advance in their profession.  On the positive side, they are
by far the toughest and strongest race in the game and heal real fast.<p>

Trolls train in the following skills: Athletics, Bridge Building, Food
Preservation, Gemology, and Mining.

<h4>HIGH ELF</h4> High Elves are a beautiful race of extremely long-lived
creatures.  High Elves are of slender build, nearly six feet 10 inches
tall and generally have golden or auburn hair and amber or purple
eyes.  Their ears are very pointed and their skin is very fair.  They
live in the forests where they like to hunt, frolic, engage in musical
and romantic affairs and generally have a good time.  They tend to
shun the other races, partially because of their arrogance and
partially because they have had conflicts with most other races in
their long history.  High Elves are excellent fighters (and also great
shots with their deadly long bows!) and mages.  Their magical powers
are especially noteworthy.  On the negative side, they are not very
well-liked and somewhat frail.<p>

High Elves train in the following skills: Dodge, Listening, Literacy,
and Stealth.

<h4>GRAY ELF</h4> Gray Elves are the most noble of all elven races.  Their
beauty is ethereal, they move with unsurpassed grace and are among the
greatest mana-wielders in the game.  Gray Elves look similar in
appearance to High Elves, although most of them sport silver or golden
hair and purple or light blue eyes.  They are of even more slender
build than their lesser cousins.  But besides their great beauty, they
are arrogant and haughty beings, generally disliked by most other
races that have contact with them (which is next to no one on a regular
basis... mostly you will meet Gray Elves in a chance encounter -- if
you notice them at all!).  Gray Elves tend to regard all the non-elven
races as lesser beings, more closely related to animals than to "True
Beings", as they like to call themselves.  They are also even more
frail than their lesser cousins, which they balance with a greatly
enhanced agility and magical powers of which other races only dream.<p>

Gray Elves train in the following skills: Dodge, Listening, Literacy,
and Stealth.

<h4>DARK ELF</h4> Dark Elves are as evil as Gray Elves are beautiful.  Many
millennia ago they were exiled into the Underdark after a long and
hateful war with the other elven sub-races.  Dark Elves worship
Lol'th, the evil demon queen of all spiders.  During the millennia beneath
the earth, they were corrupted by the dark secrets they managed to
unearth.  Their skin is as black as their souls.  In contrast, their
hair is of pure white color.  Dark Elves are of very slender frame and
slightly smaller than their surface-dwelling cousins.  Dark Elves are
hated and feared by almost everyone because of their cruelty and lack
of mercy.  They possess great magical talents, are very nimble and
have an excellent perception in the underground.  Because of their
long absence from the sunlight, they are almost blind when adventuring
in the daylight.  Their greatest enemies are their surface cousins.
Despite the general evil disposition of this race over the centuries,
they have spawned some very rare individuals who have left their
homelands and are eternally remembered in legends and song because of
their valor, goodwill, and courage.<p>

Dark Elves train in the following skills: Alertness, Climbing, Find
Weakness, and Stealth.

<h4>DWARF</h4> Dwarves are a small, hardy and taciturn race.  They barely
grow to be four and a half feet.  Their body is stocky and their
endurance is legendary.  Dwarves are especially proud of their long
beards and their great craftsmanship with metals.  The dwarven race
has spawned the greatest of all smiths.  Their skill in forging
weapons and armor is unsurpassed, as is their greed for gold.  They
are able warriors, brave to a fault, have an excellent sight in the
underground and are experts at detecting secret doors and traps.<p>

Dwarves train in the following skills: Climbing, Detect Traps,
Metallurgy, Mining, and Smithing.

<h4>GNOME</h4> Gnomes are the smaller cousins of dwarves.  They live in
rolling hills and wooded valleys.  They are great connoisseurs of gems
and the best gem carvers known in the whole world.  Gnomes are famous
for their very black humor and their great magical skills.  They are
about four feet high and not so stocky as dwarves.  They groom their
beards very well, although they generally favor short cropped beards.
Gnomes are great leather workers and gnomish boots are a quality
product every race greatly enjoys (except trolls and maybe
hurthlings).  Their greatest enemies are the kobolds living in the
tunnels below the mountains.  They normally attack each other on
sight.  Gnomes are excellent crossbowmen who prefer to utilize light
crossbows for ranged attacks.<p>

Gnomes train in the following skills: Gemology, Listening, Mining,
Pick Pockets, and Ventriloquism.

<h4>HURTHLING</h4> Hurthlings are the smallest of the little people.  They
grow to be an average three to three and a half feet high.  They are
sturdy and brave.  Most hurthlings prefer to walk without shoes.
Their feet are very well accustomed to this as they sport a leathery
sole and are covered with thick and bushy hair.  Hurthlings rarely
wear beards and generally prefer short-cut hair.  They (mostly) are
not an adventurous people.  They enjoy their burrows, like to farm and
sit together to tell stories.  Their greatest pride are their
beautiful gardens and the good tobacco they produce.  Hurthlings
generally mistrust outsiders and foreigners and shun them most of the
time.  A hurthling needs six meals a day to be happy and a comfortable
bed to sleep in.  Those few hurthlings who chose to be
adventurers are mostly very talented thieves.  Because of their small
size and their low strength, hurthlings are not very well suited to be
fighters.  One of their favored sports is tossing rocks (with or
without slings) at distant targets -- consequently many hurthlings are
deadly shots both with slings and thrown rocks. Hurthlings have been known as hobbits in later ages and in
other areas.<p>

Hurthlings train in the following skills: Archery, Cooking, Food
Preservation, Gardening, and Stealth.

<h4>ORC</h4> Orcs belong to the dark races, created in the same dark pits as
trolls.  They mostly are the arch nemesis of many of the intelligent
races, as they reproduce quickly and enjoy plundering, killing and
spreading havoc in general.  The average orc is five and a half to six
feet high, weighs 130 to 150 pounds and has a gray to black skin.
Their eyes glow red in the dark.  Orcs shun sunlight, as it tends to
hurt their eyes greatly.  Because orcs mostly live in the underground,
they are very good at detecting secret doors.  Orcs make good
fighters and are also known to spawn mighty priests serving their
cruel war deity, Gruumsh, the One-Eyed and All-Seeing.<p>

Orcs train in the following skills: Backstabbing, Climbing, Find
Weakness, Metallurgy, and Mining.

<h4>DRAKELING</h4> Drakelings are humanoid lizard-like creatures about six
feet tall.  They weigh 150 to 200 pounds and are covered with blue or
green scales.  They speak with a hissing accent and normally wear few
clothes (besides their armor and weapons).  Drakelings are able to
spit a powerful acid at enemies, although this fatigues them.  The
origins of the Drakeling race are hidden in a past long forgotten.
They reappeared some years ago and quickly spread across the
continent.  Sages believe that they remained for many centuries in a
kind of hibernation which only recently ended.  Drakelings are good at
everything.  They are very deadly shots with a weapon unique to their
race, the drakish scurgar.<p>
        Drakelings are cold-blooded creatures.  Therefore, extreme
temperatures influence them: when it gets cold, they slow down.  On the
other hand, great heat is beneficial for them as it speeds up their
reflexes. Their breath weapon causes {x}d6+{y} points of damage.  {x} is
equal to the maximum of 2 and the current PC level divided by 3. {y}
is equal to the PC level divided by 2.<p>

Drakelings train in the following skills: Alertness, Food
Preservation, Music, and Swimming.<p>

<a name="C3"></a><h3>The Classes</h3>

In ADOM, every character belongs to a certain profession which
describes what he learned in his youth.  This profession is called a
class and determines his special abilities and starting equipment
(equipment is also dependent on race).  Additionally, each class receives a
skill package to account for the knowledge you gain during your
apprenticeship (see the section on skills for a complete list of all
skills available in the game).<p>
        Finally, each and every class will provide special powers to
the character once a specific experience level is gained.  The more
powerful the character gets, the better these abilities will be.  Some
abilities are magical, some are natural talents, some are automatic,
others must be used manually, but each and every ability will serve to
simplify some aspect of your adventuring life.  Special powers are
gained at levels 6, 12, 18, 25, 32, 40 and 50.  All these special
powers are usually invoked (if this is necessary) with the C-x command
-- if this keybinding does not work for you check your online help
(press '?'-'K').<p>

The following classes can be chosen:<p>

<h4>ARCHER</h4> Archers are deadly shots.  Although the name of their class
seems to imply this, not all of them prefer to use bows.  The race of
an archer has great influence on their preferred missile weapon.
Archers are expert fighters in missile combat, rarely missing their
targets and trained to hit the vital spots of their opponents. In
close combat, archers are less formidable, although they are still
dangerous.<p>

Archers are trained in the following skills: Alertness, Archery,
Climbing, Concentration, Dodge, Fletchery, Listening, and Stealth.<p>

At higher levels archers are the most deadly marksmen in all
Ancardia.  At level 6 a missile attack takes up but 800 energy points.
At level 12 the range for their missile attacks is doubled.  At level
18 they are a lot more productive when applying fletchery.  At level
25 missile attacks cost but 600 energy points.  At level 32 they
become able to completely dodge enemy missiles.  At level 40 missiles
attacks have a 20% chance to penetrate armor and at level 50 they are
able to hit several targets with one missile.

<h4>ASSASSIN</h4> Assassins are a dark and mysterious class.  They are
trained to end the life of their opponents quickly and silently. Many
of them favor poisons to achieve this goal.<p>

Assassins are trained in the following skills: Alchemy, Alertness,
Archery, Backstabbing, Climbing, Detect Traps, Dodge, Find Weakness,
Pick Locks, Stealth, and Two Weapon Combat.<p>

At higher levels assassins get a lot more deadly in their trade.  At
level 6 they can create poison from any potion (except for water and
fruit juice).  At level 12 their backstabbing powers get a lot more
deadly.  At level 18 the range of their missile attacks is increased
by 30%.  At level 25 their chance to score critical hits is increased
by 20%.  At level 32 the dodge bonus they gain is doubled.  At level
40 they become immune to poison.  At level 50 they receive a small
chance to score instant killing hits.  This chance is based upon the
level of the target.

<h4>BARBARIAN</h4> Barbarians hail from the harsh northern lands of
Ancardia, from the roughest mountain peaks, the wildest hills and the
most remote forests.  What they lack in equipment, they more than
equalize with their great strength, enormous toughness and deadly
weaponry.  Barbarians are very well experienced in the arts of battle
and are well prepared to cope with the dangers of the wilderness.<p>

Barbarians are trained in the following skills: Athletics, Climbing,
Dodge, First Aid, Herbalism, Stealth, Survival, Swimming, Two Weapon
Combat, and Woodcraft.<p>

High-level barbarians are fearsome fighters.  At level 6 they learn to
deliver mighty blows that cause double damage (for the cost of 2500
energy points).  At level 12 moving costs but 750 energy points.  At
level 18 they can deliver tremendous blows that cause triple damage
(for the cost of 4000 energy points).  At level 25 they start to gain
+1d4 additional hit points per level.  At level 32 barbarians gain a
one-time bonus of +3 to strength and toughness.  At level 40 they gain
a +10 damage bonus with each melee attack when fighting as a true
berserker (which basically means that they have to fight naked,
e.g. without any armor, and switching the tactics rating to the
appropriate setting).  At level 50 melee attacks take up but 800
energy points when fighting as a true berserker.
IMPORTANT: Note that both the mighty and the tremendous blow count
only for the first blow, even if the character is delivering a series
of blows (because he wields more than one weapon, etc.).

<h4>BARD</h4> Bards are musicians, entertainers and entrepreneurs.  They try
to make an easy living by telling good stories for a meal. Most of
them are below average fighters and don't possess much equipment.
This is balanced by their knack to stumble upon strange items.  Apart
from that, bards make fast friends with strange beings at times.  A
bard starts his dungeoneering life with one loyal monster or animal
companion.  Once a bard has become friends with another being, this
friendship lasts for a lifetime.  Many legendary bards in Ancardia
were accompanied by monster or animal companions of equal fame.  It is
said that talented bards are able to calm the spirit of a beast with
their ethereal music.<p>

Bards are not trained in specific skills (except for Music), but
rather receive a randomly determined group of skills. They also receive
more skills than any other character class.<p>

As bards advance in level they become more and more versatile.  At
level 6 they receive one additional free skill increase per
advancement.  At level 12 they gain +1d3 skill levels in 6 randomly
chosen weapon skills.  At level 18 they receive a base score of 80 +
(10 * Learning score) + (20 * Mana score) in four randomly chosen
spells.  At level 25 they receive 6 random skills (or improve their
abilities in up to 6 skills).  At level 32 they double their hit point
regeneration speed.  At level 40 they double their mana point
regeneration rate.  At level 50 they receive a bonus of +6 to all
attributes.

<h4>BEASTFIGHTER</h4> Beastfighters are partly mystic, partly primitive
warriors who excel at weaponless combat.  They are lightly armored but
extremely tough and fearsome opponents due to their weaponless
fighting style.  They are well accustomed to wilderness settings and
very resistant to poisons -- especially to animal poisons.  The more
experienced a beastfighter becomes, the more deadly he is in melee
combat. Beastfighters are especially likely to score critical hits
when fighting animals in melee combat.<p>

Beastfighters are trained in the following skills: Athletics,
Climbing, Dodge, Healing, Herbalism, Listening, Stealth, Swimming, and
Survival.<p>

With increasing experience, beastfighters perfect their natural
fighting style and their attunement to the wild beasts.  At level 6
they become poison resistant and at level 12 their wild fighting style
makes them stun resistant.  At level 18 movement costs them but 700
energy points.  At level 25 they can summon 2d2 cave bears or silver
wolves for the cost of permanently losing one mana point (which
eventually regenerates after a lot of time has passed).  At level 32
they become able to exchange positions with hostile monsters.  At
level 40 they can stun opponents on critical hits and at level 50 they
gain +6 to both strength and toughness.

<h4>DRUID</h4> Druids are nature priests.  They worship the Old Gods and
regard all nature as a holy thing to worship and protect.  Their
specialty are spells of nature and protection.  It is said that no
animal will willingly harm a druid.<p>

Druids are trained in the following skills: Climbing, Concentration,
First Aid, Gardening, Healing, Herbalism, Listening, Literacy, Survival,
Swimming, and Woodcraft.<p>

At higher levels, druids become extremely attuned to nature itself.
At level 6 they learn to evade wilderness encounters whenever they
choose to do so.  At level 12 they regenerate power points twice as
fast as usual while in the wilderness.  At level 18 they become immune
to all weather effects.  At level 25 they are able to summon 1d3 major
animals as servants at the cost of 1d3 mana points (an almost
permanent loss, as it only regenerates after a very long period of
time).  At level 32 they regenerate hit points twice as fast as usual
while in the wilderness.  At level 40 they become immune to lightning.
Finally, they suffer 10% less corruption from all such attacks at
level 50 due to their close connection to nature.

<h4>ELEMENTALIST</h4> Elementalists are magicians specialized on dealing
with the four elements: fire, water, earth and air.  Their spells
specifically deal with those elements and their magic equipment
reflects this preference, too.  Elementalists normally don't use
written magic but employ powers they harness from within.  Their magic
thus is somewhat limited in one way and a lot more powerful in other
ways.  Elementalists generally use a less scientific approach to magic
than wizards usually do.<p>

Elementalists are trained in the following skills: Climbing,
Concentration, Gemology, Healing, Listening, Literacy, Metallurgy, and
Swimming.<p>

Experienced elementalists use very special powers provided by their
close elemental attunement.  At level 6 they become fire resistant, at
level 12 they become shock resistant.  At level 18 they are immune to
all weather effects.  At level 25 they are able to breathe water.  At
level 32 they can unleash an elemental storm at the cost of 120 power
points which fires a random bolt (fire, lightning or frost) into each
of the eight available directions, starting from the position of the
elementalist.  At level 40 they can summon an elemental as a pet.
This forces them to permanently sacrifice two mana points (which
eventually regenerate -- albeit after a very long period of time).  At
level 50 they can automatically burrow through stone (at the cost of
20 power points and 1500 energy).

<h4>FARMER</h4> Even among the most average folks, there are some valiant and
larger-than-life persons who are born to achieve more than their
parents and grand parents.  After the news about the impending danger
had spread throughout the lands, those people started their journey to
the location in the Drakalor Chain which might change their destiny --
and the destiny of their world.  Farmers are neither great fighters
nor skilled magicians, but they possess inner strength and endurance
from years of labor.  Often they are accompanied by their trusted
dogs.  They are accustomed to hunger and hardship and often have very
little to lose compared to the amount of fame they might be able to
win.  Equipped with a broad knowledge about herbs and food, they are
probably the best prepared class (except for barbarians and
beastfighters) for extensive travels.<p>

Farmers are trained in the following skills: Archery, Bridge building,
Cooking, First Aid, Fletchery, Food Preservation, Gardening, Haggling,
Herbalism, Smithing, Stealth, Survival, and Woodcraft.<p>

The more experienced farmers become, the better they adjust to their
hard circumstances of life.  At level 6 their carrying capacity is
doubled due to their training and experience with moving around great
loads during harvest time.  At level 12 they need only half as much
food as everybody else (except for monks who also know how to survive
on very little).  At level 18 they learn to pick herbs with a lot
more skill to select the better ones.  At level 25 they learn
about making iron rations from corpses.  At level 32 they receive
better chances to increase their physical attributes and physical
attribute potentials.  At level 40 they gain a +3 bonus to strength
and toughness.  At level 50 they have become so much attuned to basic
nature that all corruption effects are reduced by 30%.

<h4>FIGHTER</h4> Fighters are simple warriors who have learned how to best face
an opponent in melee combat.  Most of them are well armed and armored.
Fighters are tough and strong due to their physical training.<p>

Fighters are trained in the following skills: Athletics, Archery,
Dodge, Find Weakness, Metallurgy, Stealth, Swimming, and Two Weapon
Combat.<p>

With increasing experience, fighters become more able to efficiently
use armor as a means of protection.  Only the PV bonus of helmets,
body armor, shields, gauntlets, cloaks, girdles, and boots will be
improved in this way.  At level 6 a fighter gains +7% to PV from such
items, at level 18 this bonus is increased to +15%, at level 32 it's
+25%.  At level 12 fighters gain a +50% bonus to DV adjustment
provided by the dodge skill.  At level 25 their chance to score
critical hits is increased by 10%.  At level 40 fighters are able to
use a powerful bash attack which causes more damage (+20%) and has a
greater chance to stun their opponents.  The downside of this attack
is that it costs 500 additional energy points to use.  At level 50
fighters learn to use a powerful all-round attack costing 3500 energy
points.  This attack can be used against every opponent in the
immediate vicinity of the fighter.

<h4>HEALER</h4> Healers are exactly that -- masters of the arts of healing,
well equipped with magical healing items and means to examine
patients.  Most of them are very robust and resistant to poisons and
diseases.  Healers are not great fighters.  They prefer to save lives rather
than to take them, although they are nonetheless able to live through
fights.<p>

Healers are trained in the following skills: Alertness, Concentration,
Cooking, Find Weakness, First Aid, Healing, Herbalism, and Literacy.<p>

Experienced healers have a vast array of means at their disposal to
soothe the pain of living beings, to treat diseases and poisons and to
prevent suffering.  At level 6 they regenerate wounds at twice the
normal speed, at level 12 they triple their recovery rate.  At level
18 they become able to use both the Healing and the First Aid skill on
others (and not only themselves).  Starting with level 25 they
automatically gain access to the following spells: Calm Monsters, Cure
Light Wounds, Slow Poison and Cure Disease (with each additional level
their knowledge increases).  Starting with level 32 they gain 2d3
additional hit points per level.  At level 40 they gain access to the
following spells: Cure Serious Wounds, Neutralize Poison (again their
knowledge increases with each new level).  At level 50 they almost
immediately recover from the effects of disease, bleeding and poison
and gain a +8 bonus to their toughness score.

<h4>MERCHANT</h4> Merchants are masters of trade and bartering.  They almost
all are very wealthy, charming and experts in communication.  Each
merchant specializes in trading with a certain type of magical items
during their apprenticeship.  At the beginning of their career, they
are equipped with a sample of items to trade with (or use).  Merchants
are neither well-armed nor well-armored and have to be careful in
fights.  Should they encounter one of the rare dungeon shops, they
will probably make some great deals.<p>

Merchants are trained in the following skills: Appraising, Detect Item
Status, Gemology, Haggling, Herbalism, Literacy, Metallurgy, Pick
Pockets, and Survival.<p>

Experienced merchants become true masters of their trade -- being able
to sell almost anything to anyone and also being able to haggle for
the best prices.  At level 6 shop prices for merchants will be lowered
by 20%.  At level 12 their carrying capacity is doubled.  At level 18
shop prices will be lowered by 40%.  At level 25 they no longer are
affected by any kind of weather.  At level 32 shop prices are lowered
by 60%.  At level 40 they learn to calm monsters by giving away items.
At level 50 their carrying capacity is tripled (due to their enormous
talent of organization). Finally at that level they also learn a magic
spell that allows them to create new items.

<h4>MINDCRAFTER</h4> Mindcrafters use a very exotic and very different
magic.  They utilize their mental powers to evoke astonishing effects.
Mindcrafters are very rare and only few people have ever heard about
them.  While they are physically weak, they are mentally extremely
strong and resistant.<p>

Mindcrafters are trained in the following skills: Concentration,
Gemology, Haggling, Herbalism, Literacy, Music, and Stealth.<p>

Experienced mindcrafters master various mental powers.  At level 6
they learn to quickly recover from confusion attacks.  At level 12
they become able to sense the amount of enemies within a limited area
(that is the current level).  Starting with level 18 they gain +1d6
additional power points per level since they manage to unlock
previously untapped mental energy sources.  At level 25 their
willpower is increased by +5.  At level 32 they can block some of the
corruption they suffer when contacting beings of Chaos.  At level 40
they unlock even more unused areas of the brain and from then on gain
+3d5 additional power points (cumulative with the bonus from level 18)
per level.  At level 50 they finally manage to resist some of the
damage they suffer when contacting undead: damage is halved (see the
section on mindcraft for details).

<h4>MONK</h4> Monks are able martial artists striving to achieve perfect
mastery of body, mind and spirit.  They are experts at fighting
unarmed, very good at dodging attacks and strong of will.  Monks need
to be unencumbered to be able to use their special martial art powers.
Monks take vows of poverty at their initiation to prevent distraction
by worldly means.<p>

Monks are trained in the following skills: Alertness, Athletics,
Concentration, Dodge, Find Weakness, Healing, Literacy, and Stealth.<p>

The further monks advance, the more they hone their movement skills and
unarmed combat powers.  At level 6 monks learn to use a circular kick
with which they can hit every opponent in the vicinity (but also all
friends, so be careful).  Using this kick costs 2500 energy points.
At level 12 a normal move costs them but 800 energy points, at level
18 but 600 energy points.  At level 25 monks become able to change
positions with hostile opponents.  At level 32 they can score instant
kills in melee combat against up to human-sized creatures.  At level
40 they can do so against humanoids of any size.  At level 50 they
have become so attached to the flow of the universe that they actually
are able to resist Chaos to a certain limit -- Chaos effects are
lowered by 10%.

<h4>NECROMANCER</h4> Necromancers are practitioners of the dark arts.
Though not very effective in melee combat, their spells are deadly and
dangerous.  Their most horrible power, though, is the ability to animate
corpses and use them as slaves.  Luckily, only humanoid corpses can be
used in this evil way.  Necromancers are outlawed and despised in most
places and feared and avoided like the plague in all other locations.<p>

Necromancers are able to command the slaves they create.  Their slaves
will follow these commands without questioning.  To invoke a command, you
need to press 'C-x'.<p>

Necromancers are trained in the following skills: Alchemy, Appraising,
Concentration, Find Weakness, Food Preservation, Herbalism, Literacy,
Necromancy, and Stealth.<p>

With increasing experience, Necromancers master all aspects of
undeath.  At level 6 they slowly develop a resistance to all special
attacks from undead (like strength drain or paralyzation).  The base
chance for resistance is equal to 40% + 1% per level of the
necromancer.  At level 12 they learn to turn undead.  At level 18 they
are able to raise all humanoid corpses in sight as ghuls.  These
corpses quickly decompose and turn to ashes after a number of turns.
Each animated corpse drains 10 power points.  At level 25 they can use
the dreaded Shadow Touch, which allows them to absorb the life energy
of enemies when fighting bare-handed and wounding an enemy.  At level
32 they can raise all corpses in sight as wraiths (similar to the
power at level 18).  Each animated corpse drains 20 power points.  At
level 40 they have to pay but one-half of the usual Necromancy cost
(see the skill description) when animating undead of a power level up
to spectres.  At level 50 they finally learn to overcome Death herself
and are able to return to the living when killed, if their Toughness
at the point of death was 10 or higher.  Coming back in this way
demands a high price.  They lose one-half of their toughness and
one-half of their hit points permanently.

<h4>PALADIN</h4> Paladins are noble fighters (from the point of view of
their respective race... an orc paladin is _very_ different from a
human paladin).  They are well trained both in physical activities
(not as well as fighters, but still very good) and in philosophical
activities (not as good as priests, but...).  Paladins are generally
very well equipped by their respective churches.  Many of them possess
blessed items.<p>

Paladins are trained in the following skills: Athletics,
Concentration, Dodge, Healing, Law (if they are lawful initially),
Literacy, Stealth, Swimming, and Two Weapon Combat.<p>

With increasing experience, paladins gain holy powers fueled by their
strong beliefs and their religious upbringing.  Due to the nature of
these powers, they are not able to use them if they aren't in decent
standing with their deity.  At level 6 they can cure disease once per
1000 turns.  At level 12 they gain the ability to turn undead (this
action costs 3000 energy points to use).  At level 18 they can
discover the alignment of a beast by simply looking at it.  At level
25 they receive a protective aura which gives them +1DV per 2 levels
against chaotics (if they are lawful), lawful ones (if they are
chaotic) or non-neutral opponents (if they are neutral) while in melee
combat.  At level 32 they can use a healing touch once per 1000 turns
to cure (level - 24)d6 points of damage.  When reaching level 40 they
become highly resistant to some special melee attack powers used by
undead beasts and demons (specifically, they become resistant to
strength drain, toughness drain, sickness and paralyzation).  At level
50 they are strengthened by their beliefs so much that all corruption
effects are reduced by 30%.

<h4>PRIEST</h4> Priests serve the various gods.  They receive magical powers
from their gods but are servants for their whole lifetime.  Many of
them carry holy items.<p>

Priests are trained in the following skills: Concentration, Detect
Item Status, First Aid, Healing, Herbalism, Literacy, and Music.<p>

With increasing experience priests gain holy powers fueled by their
strong beliefs and their religious upbringing.  Due to the nature of
these powers, they are not able to use them if they aren't in decent
standing with their deity.  At level 6 priests can turn undead.  At
level 12 all spell costs are reduced by 10%.  At level 18 all spell
costs are reduced by 25%.  At level 25 all spell costs are reduced by
50%.  At level 32 priests are allowed to pray twice as often as anybody
else.  At level 40 they are able to destroy minor undead (skeletons,
zombies, ghuls, shadows, ghosts, wights, wraiths, ghost bats, slow
shadows, mummies, corpse fiends and shadow centipedes).  At level 50
they are able to destroy major undead (liches, spectres, vampires,
revenants, skeletal warriors, ghost lords, shadow trolls, master
liches, shadow lords, greater mummies and steel zombies).


<h4>RANGER</h4> Rangers are fighters favoring natural environments. They are
excellent trackers and masters at fighting with two weapons. Most of
them are wearing light armor to retain their mobility but in turn are
well armed.  Many rangers carry missile weapons.<p>

Rangers are trained in the following skills: Alertness, Archery,
Athletics, Climbing, Dodge, Food Preservation, Healing, Herbalism,
Survival, Swimming, Two Weapon Combat, and Woodcraft.<p>

The more experience rangers gain, the more attuned to nature they
become.  At level 6 they are a lot more capable to survive in the
wilderness through the means of the Survival skill as they find a lot
more food in far less time.  They also become immune to all negative
weather effects since they have by now learned to avoid all related
problems.  At level 12 rangers are no longer slowed down by terrain
effects.  At level 18 the range of all missile attacks is increased by
+4. At level 25 they can automatically evade all wilderness encounters.
At level 32 and 50 the weight of two weapons used at the same time can
be doubled/quadrupled without incurring negative effects.  Starting at
level 40 movement costs but 750 energy points.<p>

Note for the special power at levels 32/50: usually your to-hit
adjustment for fighting with two weapons is determined in the
following way:<p>
<ul>
<li>Take (Two-weapon combat / 20) as a basic bonus.
<li>Subtract 6 if you are not playing a ranger.
<li>Subtract MAX(0, (Weight of the two weapon / 10) - 6).
<li>If you are a ranger of level 32-49 it is
        "Subtract MAX(0, (Weight of the two weapon / 20) - 6)"
<li>If you are a ranger of level 50 it is
        "Subtract MAX(0, (Weight of the two weapon / 40) - 6)"
</ul>


<h4>THIEF</h4> Need we say more?  For the sake of completeness: Thieves are
very good at stealing, opening locks, finding and disarming traps and
other secretive activities.<p>

Thieves are trained in the following skills: Alertness, Appraising,
Backstabbing, Climbing, Detect Traps, Disarm Traps, Listening, Pick
Locks, Pick Pockets, and Stealth.<p>

Highly experienced thieves are masters of stealth, trickery and
robbery.  At level 6 thieves automatically use the search command on
every step they make.  At level 12 they get a lot more deadly with
backstabbing attacks.  At level 18 they become able to pilfer shops
due to their exceptional agility and skill (but take care of
experienced shopkeepers -- they might be very vigilant!).  At level 25
thieves learn very deadly (and dirty!) fighting tactics allowing them
to stun humanoid monsters with critical hits (a good kick at the right
time does wonders).  At level 32 they manage to pick the best stuff
from other folks' pockets, occasionally even discovering highly
valuable items.  At level 40 their speed is increased by +20.  At
level 50 they are invisible as long as they are adjacent to a wall due
to their exceptional stealth (but make sure that you don't carry any
light source!).

<h4>WEAPONSMITH</h4> Weaponsmiths are crafty men and women able to repair
damaged metal equipment and improve items.  Weaponsmiths normally are
well-equipped and carry the tools of their trade.  They are strong and
resilient, hardened by many hours of strenuous work.<p>

Weaponsmiths are trained in the following skills: Appraising,
Athletics, Concentration, Detect Traps, Find Weakness, Haggling,
Metallurgy, and Smithing.<p>

Weaponsmiths perfect their skills at higher experience levels.  At
level 6 they become able to melt all metal items into ingots.  At
level 12 they can forge items four times as fast as everyone else.  At
level 18 they gain a +4 bonus to strength.  At level 25 they
automatically recognize all metal types.  At level 32 weaponsmiths
become immune to fire.  At level 40 they gain a +8 bonus to toughness.
At level 50 they automatically know the damage caused by unidentified
melee weapons.

<h4>WIZARD</h4> Wizards are masters of the 'art'.  They wield great
magical powers and are able to create fireballs, lightning strikes
and magical protection spells.  Their great magical powers are
balanced by their mediocre fighting abilities.  Most mages spend their
lives studying books and conducting arcane experiments in hidden
laboratories and thus have next to no time to practice their physical
skills.<p>

Wizards are trained in the following skills: Alchemy, Concentration,
Healing, Herbalism, Literacy, Stealth, and Ventriloquism.<p>

With increasing power, wizards become more and more skilled in the
magical arts.  At level 6 all spell costs are reduced by 10%, at level
12 all costs are reduced by 20% and at level 18 all costs are reduced
by 40%.  Starting with level 25 they slowly gain experience in one
randomly chosen spell per level.  At level 32 they become able to
recharge wands (but no wand can be recharged more than once by a wizard).
Recharging costs 50 power points per charge.  If the wizard tries to
overcharge the wand, he risks losing one mana point permanently.  At
level 40 wizards learn to uncurse items.  This permanently costs one
mana point.  At level 50 they finally get basic knowledge in all
commonly known spells.<p>

<a name="06"></a><h3>Stats</h3>
Stats are referred to as Attributes in the <a href="adomman-H.html#H1">ADOM Manual</a>. A basic description of
them can be found there. The current value for stats is displayed on the main
game screen. The current value and the potential maximum value for the PC's
stats can be found on the screen shown by the <tt>@</tt> command.<p>

Stats can increase or decrease for many reasons, some of which are detailed 
below. When a stat changes, the following messages are generated:<p>

<a name="060"></a><table border=1>
<caption>Stat changes</caption>
<tr><th>Stat<th>Increases <th> Decreases
<tr><td>Strength <td>Your muscles feel stronger <td> Your muscles soften
<tr><td>Learning <td>You feel studious <td> Thinking seems to get tougher
<tr><td>Willpower <td>Your will seems inflexible <td> You feel soft-hearted
<tr><td>Dexterity <td>Your movements are getting swifter <td> You are getting shaky
<tr><td>Toughness <td>Your health increases <td> It seems that you are getting a cold
<tr><td>Charisma <td>You feel very self-confident <td> You feel reserved
<tr><td>Appearance <td>Your looks improve <td> You are growing a wart
<tr><td>Mana <td>You feel more in touch with the world <td> You are getting out of touch with everything
<tr><td>Perception <td>Your senses sharpen <td> You seem to get less perceptive
</table><p>

<a name="061"></a><h4>0.6.1 Increasing stats</h4>
It is to any PC's advantage to raise stats to the potential maximum and beyond. 
There are several ways to do this. Stats may be increased to their potential
maximum (and beyond) naturally by training the stat.<p>

<a name="0611"></a><h4>0.6.1.1 Training stats naturally</h4>
<table border=1>
<caption>How to train stats naturally</caption>

<tr><td rowspan=6>Strength
						<td> Burdened if St<15, Strained if St<16, Strained! if St<18, Overburdened if St<20

</table><p>

The Athletics skill also helps raise physical stats (St, Dx, To) more quickly and has a half 
effect on Appearance. It trains twice as fast if stat &lt; 10, and three times as fast if
stat &lt; 5. It happens at only level up, basic effect is skill level x 100.<p>

<a name="06111"></a><b>Training explained</b><p>
Training value is associated with every stat, ranging from -5000 to 5000.
Natural training happens once in 500-1000 turns, and always at level up. Every level 
up trains every stat by level if it's not at potential max. If St &lt; 10, train by 100 at 
level up, if &lt; 5 another 100. Also with Toughness.<p>

There is a chance that the stat will be increased or decreased on each check. 
No training occurs if Training=0, if Training>0 then a stat increase is possible, otherwise 
a stat decrease is possible. <p>

If the stat isn't at maximum (or Training is negative), number from 1 to N is rolled randomly,
 and if abs(Training) &gt; RolledNumber, 
then the stat is increased or decreased. It means the smaller N, the bigger chance for a stat change.
If Learning>9 (or Training is negative), N = X*(Stat+10), otherwise N = X*(Stat+20-Le).
X=50 if Training is positive, X=10 if negative; it means negative training generates 5 times smaller
N, thus is 5 times more effective. If the stat was increased, Training is decrerased by 1000 points, but
not below zero. If a stat decrease occured, Training is set to 0.<p>

If the stat is at its potential (and Training is positive), or it is not at potential but 1/10 chance, (another)
number from 1 to StatPotential*100+750 is rolled randomly. If Training &gt; RolledNumber, then the stat potential 
goes up and Training is decreased by (another) 2000 points, but not below 0. <p>

Finally, another 1000 points of Training are removed, not below 0. To sum up, PC loses 1000 points 
of Training on unsuccessfull check, 2000 on stat increase, 3000 on potential increase, and 4000 
on stat and potential increase.<p>

<a name="0612"></a><h4>0.6.1.2 Training with Garth</h4>
The dwarven weaponmaster Garth, found in Dwarftown, can be paid to increase 
stats other than Appearance and Mana. The formula for how much to pay is 
($100 * stat)+1 value, doubled once for each 5 points over 15. This is a 
general formula that may vary according to the PC's race (probably myth).<p>

See section <a href="adomgb-2-5.html#255">2.5.5</a> for a bit more detail on training with Garth.<p>

<a name="0613"></a><h4>0.6.1.3 Training stats with herbs</h4>
Two of the herbs can be used in order to increase stats to a maximum of 
about 25-27 per stat. These are:
<ul>
<li>Morgia root - Willpower and Toughness (eat)<p>
Morgia Root trains Toughness up to 25, 5d100+200; trains Willpower up 
to 25, 50d10. B/U/C DOESN'T MATTER. About 18 are needed to maximize chance
for Willpower.
<!--
Eating 2 morgia roots, any status, will train Toughness. Eating 4 morgia
roots, any status, will also train Willpower. If the stats are already
at their potential maximum, 8 morgia roots are required. Eating more than 
8 at once is a waste of morgia roots. (given the exact formulae above, this 
could be regarded as myth) <p>-->

<li>Moss of mareilon - Dexterity (use)<p>
Using Moss of Mareilon trains Dexterity up to 25, Cursed: -10d100, 
Uncursed: 10d100, Blessed: 60d30+30. About 6 blessed patches are needed to 
maximize chances for increase.
<!--
Using 2 blessed or uncursed mosses of mareilon trains Dexterity. 
Blessed herbs have much greater effect. If the dexterity stat is already
at its potential maximum, 4 mosses of mareilon 
are required. Using more than 4 at once is a waste of moss of mareilon. 
Using cursed mosses of mareilon abuses the dexterity stat. (given the exact 
formulae above, this could be regarded as myth) <p>-->
</ul><p>

<b>Tip:</b> when your Wi/To 
stats or your Dx stat is 24 and the natural maximum is greater than 24 (in 
other words, when one more increase would put you to 25), use all of the 
morgia and not cursed moss of marelion you can, since once you hit 25, the herbs
become useless. But if you pack on the training at 24, you may still get another 
increase or two after you hit 25, from the remainder.<p>

In any case, do not eat or use additional herbs until the stat increases 
have taken effect - this may take a while.<p>
<!--
Note that training stats in 
this way is more effective when the stats are low. Eating four morgia, for 
instance, may cause two or three increases in willpower and toughness if 
the stats are in the single digits. Once above ten, the stat increases 
seem to occur one point at a time. (myth - see formulaes above)<p>-->

<a name="0614"></a><h4>0.6.1.4 Increasing stats by eating corpses</h4>
Many corpses have an affect on stats. Some simply increase a given stat, 
others will increase one stat while decreasing another. Some have a limit, 
that is, they will only increase a stat to a certain number, after which 
they will have no effect. Others affect stats regardless of their value.<p>

For example, spellcaster corpses have 17% probability of granting +1 Ma, 
except for kobold shaman corpse, which always grants +1 Ma, but also causes sickness.
Refer to section <a href="adomgb-0-3.html#033">0.3.3</a> for the other effects resulting 
from eating monster corpses.<p>

<a name="0615"></a><h4>0.6.1.5 Increasing stats with potions</h4>
There are five kinds of potions that increase or decrease the PC's stats 
directly: potions of -stat-, potions of potential -stat-, potions of boost 
-stat-, potions of gain attributes and potions of carrot juice. Rearranging 
stats is dealt with below.<p>

Potions of -stat- behave as follows:<p>
<ul>
<li>Uncursed potion of -stat-: an uncursed potion of -stat- will increase the value 
of -stat- by one, and increases the potential maximum plus one
    
<li>Blessed potion of -stat- : a blessed potion of -stat- will increase the value of 
-stat- by two, and increases the potential maximum plus two
    
<li>Cursed potion of -stat- : a cursed potion of -stat- will decrease the value of 
-stat- by one, and decreases the potential maximum by one
    
<li>Potions of potential -stat- do the same with your stat potential, which determines
the natural maximum of your PC in that stat.
    
<li>Potions of boost -stat- work like potions of -stat-, but give a bigger boost that
is *temporary*. These are useful when you need to get some stat over a certain
limit, such as the Wi: 32 border that allows for bigger ball spells. Another useful 
application is to use potions of boost learning just before a level increase, which 
will probably boost learning enough to increase the number of skill increases 
allowed.
    
<li>Potions of gain attributes raise the value of a single stat by one if uncursed or 
all stats by one if blessed. Note that they do not raise potential maximums. 
They only increase potential maximums to the resulting value of -stat-, when 
necessary.
    
<li>Potions of carrot juice can be used to increase Perception. Drinking a blessed
potion of carrot juice will increase Perception by +1. Drinking an uncursed potion
of carrot juice may increase Perception if the Pe score is very low; this needs to
be tested. After 20, it becomes more difficult to raise Perception with blessed
potions of carrot juice. When Perception is below 20, the message "Your eyesight
seems to improve!" is generated. Above 20, the message is absent even if Perception
is increased. There is a special room effect "The air of this room is
filled with the smell of carrots." which will cause a one-time +5 increase to 
perception when a blessed or uncursed potion of carrot juice is consumed while 
in the room.
</ul><p>

<a name="0616"></a><h4>0.6.1.6 Crystals of knowledge</h4>
'U'sing crystals of knowledge has two possible effects: if the crystal is 
uncursed, a bit of the level layout around the PC is revealed. If the 
crystal is blessed, a 1d2 increase to the Learning stat may also 
occur. In ADOM 1.0.0+, there is a limit similar to that encountered with 
herbs: Learning increase mostly fails around 25 - 27 or so with blessed crystals 
of knowledge.<p>

<a name="062"></a><h4>0.6.2 Rearranging stats</h4>
<a name="0621"></a><h4>0.6.2.1 Potions of exchange</h4>
Drinking a potion of exchange changes your stats, not taking into account any 
effects from corruption or equipment. A cursed potion of exchange swaps six stats 
randomly, an uncursed one twists five, and a blessed one swaps two stats around.<p>

<a name="0622"></a><h4>0.6.2.2 Potions of balance</h4>
Potions of balance can be very, very helpful if you know how to use them.
When you drink one, the game calculates the average of all of your stats,
rounds it down, and adds a number depending on the potion's status. For a
blessed potion, it's +3, uncursed 0, and cursed -3. The stat changes are based
on this final score.<p>

If a stat exceeds this score, it's lowered by one. If it's below this, it's
raised by one. If it's equal, it remains unchanged.<p>

Therefore, if you have a well-rounded character, with most or all stat scores 
close to each other and drink a blessed potion of balance, you will get a 
boost to most or all stats.<p>

However, this only happens with 100-4*(StatAverage-10) % chance. This means 100%
chance for stat averages of 10, 0% for 35. The B/U/C status of the potion is counted
towards that StatAverage as explained earlier. Otherwise, alignment is moved 
towards neutrality instead.<p>

Note also that potions of balance take into account all stat-modifying elements 
including worn equipment, wielded equipment and corruptions.<p>

<a name="063"></a><h4>0.6.3 Increasing stats beyond their usual limits</h4>
Certain afflictions will lower stats. While suffering from these, the PC can take
advantage of this fact to increase his stats. Once the affliction wears off or is
removed, the stat will recover and exceed the usual limit.<p>

<b>Sickness:</b> -2 to several stats; -5 to Toughness<p>

<b>Starvation:</b> -4 to Strength as soon as Starving status is reached. As time passes,
Strength, Learning, Willpower and Dexterity begin dropping. They will eventually reach
half their starting value (Strength reaches half the value after the immediate -4). While
the stats are dropping, the PC is not in danger of starving to death. When the stats reach the
halfway point, the PC is in danger of dying and should eat something. Since Starvation halves
stats rather than simply decrementing them it is much more powerful than Sickness.<p>

<b>Rings of weakness:</b> Decreases Strength to 2. Be careful to drop the PC's pack (and heavy
worn equipment i.e. Big Punch) before using rings of weakness.<p>

An extremely convenient scenario for these tactics is mining out a level that supports herbs.
Morgia roots and moss of mareilon train Toughness, Willpower and Dexterity. Stomacemptia can be
used for Starvation. Mining will generate crystals of knowledge for training Learning and Stone
Giant corpses for increasing Strength. Even better if it is near Dwarftown. Most PCs will not
have the Mining skill or an artifact pickaxe and will need Glod's help repairing pickaxes for
1500 gold pieces. This exploit should raise these stats into the 50s.<p>

<b>Garth</b> (section <a href="adomgb-2-5.html#255">2.5.5</a>) is a potentially endless source of
stat increases for those stats he trains. The limitless gold available from the Casino can be
used for this.<p>

<a name="064"></a><h4>0.6.4 Luck</h4>
Luck is a hidden property of the PC, which is not stored anywhere, but rolled
whenever needed. This Guidebook sometimes references to Luck. The following table
explains how Luck is calculated.<p>

<table border=1><caption>Luck modifications</caption>
<tr><th>Condition <th>Luck modification
<tr><td>being Blessed 	<td>+2
<tr><td>birthday 	<td>+1d12+1
<tr><td>+Luck intrinsic <td>+3
<tr><td>+Fate intrinsic <td>+6
<tr><td>ankh or platinum girdle equipped <td>+3
<tr><td>correctly equipped item that grants +Luck <td>+2
<tr><td>correctly equipped item that grants +Fate <td>+4
<tr><td>always <td>if 1d100 < Ma then +Max(1d(Ma/10+2)-1,4)
<tr><td>+Curs intrinsic <td>-2d2
<tr><td>+Doom intrinsic <td>-3d5
<tr><td>correctly equipped items that grants +Curs <td>-1d(Number of +Curs items * 3)+1
<tr><td>correctly equipped items that grants +Doom <td>-1d(Number of +Doom items * 8)+1
<tr><td>savegame cheating <td>-1d200
</table><p>

The actual Luck roll is 1dGoodLuck-1 + BadLuck, where GoodLuck are conditions which increase Luck,
and BadLuck are conditions which decrease luck (last 5 rows from the above table). This gives overall 
positive or negative bonus to the situation. Note that being Doomed in itself will also further impact 
many situations beyond the Luck roll penalty above. <p>

<a name="065"></a><h4>0.6.5 Speed</h4>
The speed system is well covered in the <a href="adomman-O.html#O3">ADOM Manual</a>.
The following table quantitates the means of modifying PC's speed.<p>
<table border=1><caption>Speed modifiers</caption>
<tr><th>Activity 	<th>Speed modifier
<tr><td>Slowed (Slow Monster, or by an opponent) <td>	-50%
<tr><td>Overburdened! <td>	-40
<tr><td>Strained! <td>	-20
<tr><td>Strained <td>	-10
<tr><td>Bloated <td>	-10
<tr><td>Burdened <td>	-5
<tr><td>Satiated <td>	-5
<tr><td>Drunk <td> -5
<tr><td>Starving <td> -5
<tr><td>Talents (Quick, Very Quick, Greased Lightning) <td>	+2, +5, +9
<tr><td>Athletics skill <td>	up to +8
<tr><td>Raven birthsign <td>	+10
<tr><td>Dexterity <td>	+1 for every 2 points above 17
<tr><td>Wish <td> +20d20, +1 permanent 
</table><p>

Monks and Beastfighters also receive speed bonuses as they level. Some items such 
as a quicksilver staff, ring/amulet of speed, or boots of the slow shuffle can also 
impact the PC's speed. Corpses of monster such as quicklings and claw bugs and 
potions of quickling blood can also increase base speed.<p>

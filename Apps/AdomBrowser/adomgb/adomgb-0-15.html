<a name="0f"></a><h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<a name="0f1"></a><h4>0.15.1 Dungeon generation</h4>
Thanks to gut for the following observations.<p>

Dungeon generation has a few peculiarities that may be worth mentioning.
Almost all rooms generated on any level will have an odd number of floor
spaces available. To my knowledge, the only exception to this is the very
rare random shop room. They are capable of being generated with an even
number of available floor spaces, and this causes the 'dig' algorithm in the
game to be unable to connect them to the rest of the map. The only way
to reach these shops is by tunneling.<p>

Remarks about staircase generation and room layout:<p>

When hopping in the ID, I noticed that some rooms were likely to have staircases in the adjacent
room. Basically, if you enter a room that's <i>in</i> a corner, or <i>near</i> a corner, and your
room has a door that leads <i>directly</i> up, down, left or right, into a corner, there is
likely a stair room there.<p>

For example, if a room like this:<p>
<pre>
   #########
   #.......#
   #.<.....#
   #.......#
   #####.###
       #+#
</pre>
is generated at the top of the level, at the left or right-hand corners, it 
likely leads to a stair room.<p>

Please note that this:<p>
<pre>
   #########
   #.......#
   #.<.....###
   #.........#
   #########.#
           #.#
           #.#
           ..#
</pre>
isn't the same, and will not work.<p>

One like this:<p>
<pre>
      #+#
   ####.####
   #.......#
   #.<.....#
   #.......#
   #########
</pre>
at the bottom left or right-hand corners is good too.<p>

A room like this:<p>
<pre>

 #######
 #.....##
 #.<....+
 #.....##
 #######
</pre>
has a high probability if it is generated at the right-hand side of the map, 
but it has to be at the very top or bottom, right next to a corner.<p>

The same goes for a room like this:<p>
<pre>
 #######
##.....#
+....<.#
##.....#
 #######
</pre>
in the left hand side of the level.<p>

A room like this :<p>
<pre>
 #######
##.....###
.....<....
##.....###
 #######
</pre>
is also good if next to any corner, but doesn't seem as sure as the others.<p>

<a name="0f2"></a><h4>0.15.2 Kicking</h4>
<b>General</b><p>
KickBonus is normally 0. Strong Legs talent gives +15, Monks get +Level*2.
Kicking is not possible while in a pit or webs or the wilderness.
Kicking while confused, stunned, or blind requires a 
Stat in Stat+40 check; Stat is Dexterity for blindness and Willpower for Confused
and Stunned state.<p> 

<b>Doors</b><p> 
Kicking a door will succeed St + KickBonus times in St + 12 (112 if the door is secret). Successfully kicking doors will 
cause tension rooms to crumble, will always trigger traps, and trains St. There is a 20% chance that 1d2 sticks will 
be created. Unsuccessfully kicking a door has a 14-St chance in 15 of training St. If the door is trapped, 
you have a (Ma + 1) in 30 chance of NOT triggering it. If you avoid the trap, you will train Mana. Failing to kick open 
an undiscovered secret door is treated as kicking an undiggable wall. If a secret door is kicked open and discovered at the same 
instant, it has a 10% chance of being trapped.<p>

<b>Walls</b><p> 
Level 13+ Monks can kick down walls on a straight Strength in 100 roll. Non-monks kicking walls will take 1dN damage, 
N = Max(2, St/3). Add 2 to N if the wall is non-diggable.<p>

<a name="0f3"></a><h4>0.15.3 Item destruction</h4>
Item destruction has two parameters, the elemental type, and the maximum number of items to destroy. 
There are 7 elements which can cause item destruction or damage (max number of items in parenthesis): 
<ul>
<li>fire: ToEF (2 every turn), exploding spellbook (1000), failed Alchemy (Min(1,dmg/5))
<li>ice: D:49
<li>acid: acid trap (Min(1,dmg/5))
<li>lightning: Air Temple (Min(1,dmg/5))
<li>water: water trap (1000), pool (1000), rain (1), Swimming (50% chance, 1000 items), water orb insertion on D:48
<li>crushing: falling Rift (40), ceiling door trap (DL), pit traps, failed mountaineering (Min(1,dmg/5)) 
<li>ripping: exploding rune door trap
</ul><p>

Equipped rings of ice or fire have chance of negating equipment fire or ice damage,
respectively. The RingBonus is 98/80/50 B/U/C for each equipped ring. All damage is negated
if Min(99, RingBonus+Luck) <= 1d100. Fireproof/waterproof blankets protect inventory (not equipment) 
100% against fire/water damage respecively, regardless of B/U/C status. Fireproof blanket is destroyed if
5/15/100 B/U/C + (GoodLuck-BadLuck) * 10 >=1d1000. Always the best blanket is selected if there are multiple. 
Note that in this case BadLuck actually 
increases fireproof blanket longevity (probably bug). Waterproof blankets are not destroyed in this manner.<p>

For fire, ice, acid and lightning elemental damage being resistant decreases chances of item damage.
The Divisor starts at 1; there is +2 if you are intrinsically resistant, +3 if you 
are intrinsically immune, +1 per equipped item granting resistance, and +3 per equipped 
item granting immunity. Note this is different from resistance to HP damage.<p>

Items which are not immune (0% in the below table) have a base chance of destruction or damage depending 
only on the item's material and the element in question. This chance is reduced by 20% (rounding down) if 
the item is blessed. It is then increased by 50% if the item is rusty and twice your Luck is subtracted. 
Finally, the chance is divided by the Divisor above.<p> 

<table border=1><caption>Base item destruction chance</caption>

</table><p>

Some other facts regarding item destruction:
<ul>
<li>If a stack of items is targetted, the number of actually demaged/destroyed items is 1dNumberOfItemsInStack.
<li>Any item/element combination value of 1% is completely safe if the item is blessed and the PC does not have negative Luck
<li>Thick gauntlets automatically resist damage 75% of the time
<li>Artifacts cannot be damaged
<li>Any item grating resistance can't be damaged by the
corresponding element. This is not true for items granting immunity. 
<li>Always half of items in inventory are safe from damage. This changes as items are picked or dropped, or the iventory is viewed.
<li>Equipment items are considered for damage, starting from the bottom and working up; tools are the first to take a hit and the helmet is the last 
<li>Body armor cannot be damaged during wearing or removing
<li>Rings under gauntlets can't be damaged; however gauntlets may get destroyed first leaving rings vulnerable
<li>No items can be damaged during a long interruptible action, such as reading a book.
<li>Rustproofed and naturally rustproof items cannot be affected by water.  
<li>The room effect "scarred by many fights" triples chance of item destruction.
<li>Items made of glass are 100% destroyed if kicked.

[1] instead of a corpse<p>
[2] never both<p>
[3] moderate-sized monsters will have a 10% chance to drop a big missile weapon (long bow or heavy crossbow) instead of a small one. 
Smaller monsters will always drop a smaller weapon<p>

<a name="0f5"></a><h4>0.15.5 Giving stuff to monsters</h4>
PC can give away items via the 'g'ive item to monster command. This mostly results in monster ignoring or refusing to take the
item, gold being exception. Other possible results are compiled below. Empty effect field basically means no effect apart from 
some kind of different message.<p>

<a name="0f7"></a><h4>0.15.7 Bugs</h4>
The list is by no means complete. Very minor bugs and typos are not listed.<p>

<a name="0f71"></a><h4>0.15.7.1 Bugs causing the game to crash</h4>
<ul>
<li>Taking the Skilled talent on character creation
<li>Dipping gold into potion of exchange
<li>Eating werewolf king corpse
<li>Giving out poisoned meat
<li>Dipping fluff ball into water, when there is no room for the gremlins
<li>Extended drop with wrong identified state (happens most often with ingots)
<li>Occasionaly, saved Khelavaster dropping spellbooks
<li>Occasionaly, chatting to an unique scared by the unholy aura corruption (proven with Thrundarr)
<li>Companion or slave berserking itself
<li>Generating and using negative heaps of gold created via dragon gold doubling
<li>Some uniques (Gaab'Baay for sure) stepping on a trap
<li>Mindcrafter killing corrupting monsters that stand behind other monsters with Mindcraft
<li>GetTargetData (-2) - this can happen randomly; however very rare 
</ul><p>

<a name="0f72"></a><h4>0.15.7.2 Bugs causing unfair death</h4>
<ul>
<li>Monster equipping moloch armor - the energy of doing so should be 37600, 
but wraps around to -27936, giving the monster 28 free turns
<li>Kicking walls with St&lt;3 can cause extraordinary damage (another wrap)
<li>Death on a Monday from low HP
<li>Moving huge amounts of gold into missile slot can result in death if wearing girdle
of greed - the girdle takes into account only gold carried in inventory 
</ul><p>

<a name="0f73"></a><h4>0.15.7.3 Bugs used to get unfair advantage</h4>
Taking advantage of (or abusing) bugs in this category is generaly frowned upon.
At least, you should mention which bugs you took advantage of when posting YAVP.<p>
<ul>
<li>Naming the unseen - the 'n'ame command can be used to detect invisible monsters,
even without the See Invisible intrinsic
<li>Piety overflow - pissing a god too much causes the piety to wrap around to very high
positive value, allowing for many crownings
<li>Dragons can pick up gold which is then effectively doubled when they are killed.
See <a href="adomgb-0-9.html#094">0.9.4</a>
<li>The Monk's circular kick ability, as well as Fighter's all round attack, have issues when 
non-hostiles are near; it will ask
if you're sure you want to kick or attack them, and you select no - your kick/attack still 
hits the other monsters, but no time passes
<li>Using fast pickup command ';' while standing on a pile of items, then canceling it ('q'), 
causes the number of elapsed game turns to decrease; this can be used to get ludicrous bonus  
to high score
<li>Starting to walk against a wall wastes one turn without the PC moving; this can
be abused to get free HP and PP regenration without monsters being allowed to act 
<li>The Good Learner talent grants 40% more xp, instead of the stated 2%
<li>Kick robbing - items can be kicked out of shop if a corner wall is destroyed - the game 
doesn't consider this technique robbing at all
<li>Casino gambling happens in one turn, the PC doesn't get the corruption it should; and 
winnings are virtually guaranteed
<li>Blessing undead while invisible will not make them aware of your presence, and you can 
kill them without them fighting back; works also with bolt spells and Drakeling's acid spit;
same for monsters who don't see in darkness; unless panicked, they just stay in place and take damage
<li>Stat training from herbs/corpses/Garth is based on modified stats instead of base stats;
this leads to abuse of sickness and starvation to pump stats unrealistically high
<li>Necromancers lvl50 using +To equipment can return to life indefinitely
<li>Look command detects webs outside visibility if level has been explored before
<li>Wish engines - a way to get unlimited wishes
<ol>
<li>Gather a stack of 19 rings, and a handful of potions of exchange
<li>Bless the potions and dip the rings into them at DL 8 to have best chance for generating
rings of djinni summoning; since 19 rings can be dipped at once, a lucky PC can end up with 
19 wishes from this alone
<li>The probability of getting a ring of djinni summoning is about 5%; if you wish for potions of exchange, 
you get an average of 3, so converting all wishes into potions (minus a few water) gives ~57 PoEX; 
the odds of being able to get more RoDS is pretty high at this point
</ol>
</ul><p>

<a name="0f74"></a><h4>0.15.7.4 Other bugs</h4>
<ul>
<li>Berserking - monster can sometimes panic and attack themselves
<li>Half of the artifacts are only available as crowning gifts, and can never be 
generated randomly
<li>The rate of corruption increases at the 90-day mark, but doesn't again at 
the 180 and 270 day marks as it's supposed to  
<li>Unicorn birthsign increases how quickly alignment changes towards chaotic 
instead of decreasing it
<li>It is possible for experience gains to overflow; the most common example would 
probably be killing too many cats results in the Cat Lord giving only 1 xp,
but there are other possibilities as well
<li>+Crit armor does not improve critical hits rate
<li>Killing something using PoCC doesn't yield any xp
<li>Elementalists don't get fire resistance at level 6, but they should
<li>The formula for potential stat gains (e.g. from corpses) is bugged; it's 100% 
likely at 28 -stat-, but 55% at 22 (and is odd in between)
<li>Cursed scrolls of repair will "break" normally unbreakable equipment, 
like herbs and potions
<li>PCs with high Swimming skill use more energy to move while in water than PCs without
Swimming
<li>Darkness does not work on door squares
<li>Fireproof blankets works better with BadLuck (see also <a href="adomgb-0-15.html#0f3">0.15.3</a>)
<li>Invisible monsters yield double xp when even when the PC has +SeeI
<li>Door traps set off by monsters will attribute kills to the PC
<li>Bats do see in the dark, but don't see invisible
<li>Covered pit bug - If a PC digs a hole, and proceeds to cover the hole with a 
plain blanket, instead of a covered pit trap appearing, the trap will magically 
transform into whatever kind of trap is appropriate for that square
<li>Entering 0 when using the Wizard's 'r'echarge wands ability causes the wand to dissappear
without any further effect or message; just hitting Enter causes overcharge
<li>Blind PC's cannot insert orbs into anomalies on D:48
<li>Pissing off the Balance god via reading tract of order/chaos is incorrectly
displayed as pissing off the Order god
<li>While staying on top of a pit, one can repeatedly activate the trap to repeatedly 
fall into the pit, without having to climb out
<li>Aquatic beings can be tamed and then taken for a walk on the mountains
<li>Raised corpses slowly decompose until they crumble - however if they are out of sight 
they do not die and have a negative amount of hitpoints
<li>If wearing a ring of teleport control and have +TCtr intrinsic, you can lose the ability 
to control teleportation by drinking from pool, despite wearing the ring
<li>Room effects don't take darkness/invisibility into account
<li>To avoid a falling door trap, the PC jumps back on the square that he came from; if this 
is blocked, the PC won't jump anywhere, despite there might be another vacant square
<li>Gold has hidden B/U/C status: if you have 19 or less gold pieces, you can dip the entire stack into a potion 
of unholy water; then wield 1 gp in either hand. The gold piece cannot be removed. This does not work
when you have more gold - the stack will remain uncursed; similarly, angry deity can curse wielded gold

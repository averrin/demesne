<h3>The Pyramid</h3>
<A HREF="adomgb-2-9-pic.html" target="blank">Click here</A> for color maps of the Pyramid.<p>
The pyramid is located in the wilderness, slightly east of the exact center of the map.  
It can be entered once the PC reaches experience level 13. When this happens, the game
generates a message: "You suddenly feel ancient magical energies manifest in your 
vicinity." Searching the current location will reveal the papyrus scroll, which is an
invitation to enter the pyramid. Note the papyrus scroll will not appear in the Animated
Forest. It is not necessary to read, or even find, the scroll
for admission to the pyramid. It asks the PC to come as soon as possible. Do not be
fooled by this. It is best to wait as long as possible before entering the pyramid,
since it is a rather nasty place. The entrance to the pyramid closes permanently if
the PC reaches experience level 17. Ideally the PC should reach experience level 16 and
keep very careful track of his experience points. Approach the pyramid when the PC is
close to achieving level 17, within a couple hundred points. Wander around in the
vicinity of the pyramid to generate wilderness encounters. Killing monsters in the
wilderness should enable the player to fine-tune his experience score to the point where 
very few additional points are needed to achieve level 17. Then enter the pyramid.
The first couple of kills in the pyramid will raise the PC to experience level 17, 
maximizing the chances of success in the pyramid. Keep a *very* close eye on those
experience points. You don't want to accidentally achieve level 17 and have the pyramid
close, because Rehetep carries two artifacts.<p>

Once the PC has killed Rehetep, the pyramid remains open permanently. The fact that it closes
at PC experience level 17 if Rehetep remains alive is a potential game-breaker. If the PC
drops a Chaos Orb in the Pyramid, then achieves experience level 17 outside without killing
Rehetep, the game is over. Since the Chaos Orb is inside an inaccessible location, it will
never be possible to open the passage to D:49. Note this same scenario can occur with the
Ruined City (Minotaur Maze, section <a href="adomgb-2-20.html">2.20</a>).<p>

<a name="291"></a><h4>2.9.1 The first two levels</h4>
The first level of the pyramid has the following layout:<p>
<pre>
 ###########                              #######

</pre>
The numeral 1 is used to indicate the presence of a secret door. Note the traps. These 
are guaranteed traps. There will also be a number of non-guaranteed traps present. The 
location of the non-guaranteed traps changes from game to game.  Also note the tools 
represented by the ( symbol. This cache of tools is guaranteed and includes thieves' 
picks, a climbing set and a pickaxe. The tools are always located on top of a trap.<p>

The inhabitants of this level include (greater) mummies, ghosts, spectres, jackal demons, 
jackalweres, jackals and hyenas. Mummies can cause sickness. It is very unwise to enter
the pyramid without some means of dealing with sickness. The fastest and easiest way to
cure sickness is with blessed or uncursed curaria mancox herbs.<p>

</pre>
Again the numeral 1 indicates secret doors. This level is very similar to the first level
in terms of monsters and traps. There is no guaranteed equipment here.<p>

Monsters who can be generated in the Pyramid consist of the following:
skeleton (double chance),   
jackal (thrice chance),
jackalwere (double chance),
mummy (quadruple chance),
ghost (double chance),
spectre,
large jackal,
jackal demon (double chance),
greater mummy.<p>
  
<a name="292"></a><h4>2.9.2 The top level</h4>
The top level of the pyramid has the following layout:<p>
<pre>
      #######
     ##..Z..##
    ##.......##
#####&.......&#####
#Z@.............@Z#
#.#.............#.#

     #########
</pre>
There is a unique feature on this level. The down staircase, represented by the &gt; symbol,
changes location randomly once when the PC enters the level (unless the PC is wearing ankh). 
This forces the PC to fight 
his way to the new location if a retreat is necessary. Furthermore, the monsters on the 
level will not follow the PC down the stairs. In older gammas of ADOM, it was possible to 
lure the monsters down the stairs one at a time and dispatch them. It doesn't work in 
current versions of the game.<p>

The Z at the top represents Rehetep, the Mummy Lord. The remaining Zs are mummies. The & 
characters are jackal demons, which have a confusion attatck. The @ characters represent a 
random monster, generally somewhat out of depth, but not terribly so. Bear in mind that 
mummies see invisible. If the PC is fortunate enough to have a means of invisibility at 
this point, use it and take out the mummies first.<p>

If the PC has a means of controlled on demand teleportation, the fight becomes simpler.
Rehetep normally recites a speech as soon as the PC moves, waking all the other monsters
on the level. In ADOM 1.1.1, if the PC teleports adjacent to Rehetep on arrival, he does
not speak and the PC only has to fight Rehetep and the two jackal demons nearest to him.<p>

<a name="2921"></a><h4>2.9.2.1 Rehetep</h4>
Rehetep the Mummy Lord holds two powerful artifacts, the Ankh and the Ancient Mummy 
Wrapping. A Greater Identify of each is below:<p>
<pre>
----------------- blessed ancient mummy wrapping [+1, +5] {Ap-8}---------------

It is an artifact.

When worn it modifies DV by +1 and PV by +5.
When used in melee combat it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d1 points of
damage. When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d1
points of damage.

It modifies your appearance attribute by -8.
It grants resistance to sleep attacks.
It grants resistance to stunning.
It grants resistance to death attacks.
It grants the ability to see invisible things.
It grants IMMUNITY to cold attacks.

--------------------------------- uncursed ankh--------------------------------

It is an artifact.

When worn it modifies DV by +2 and PV by +2.
When used in melee combat it grants a -4 bonus to hit and causes 1d3 points of
damage. When used as a missile it grants a -4 bonus to hit and causes 1d3
points of damage.

It increases your luck.
It grants luck.
It makes Fate smile upon you.
</pre>
Note that the [+2, +2] nature of the Ankh is not revealed explicitly except when 
Greater Identified. Note also that it not only grants the Lucky and Fate smiles 
intrinsics, but also increases luck, a hidden property used by the game when calculating 
dice rolls, etc.<p>

The artifact Ancient Mummy Wrapping is the only mummy wrapping that weighs 60 stones.  
Be sure not to confuse it with other mummy wrappings. They are all described as a 
"strange wrapping" prior to identification. The resistances granted by the Ancient Mummy 
Wrapping are considerable and should give clues about how to attack Rehetep. Using cold 
based attacks is, of course, useless. Rehetep and other mummies are vulnerable to 
fire. This is where the wand of fireballs available from Thrundarr as a quest reward 
comes in very handy. Do not give up when messages about Rehetep "shrugging off" fire
based attacks are generated. He will succumb to repeated fire attacks. All mummies 
including Rehetep are vulnerable to undead slaying ammo, of course.<p>

Note that the combination of cold immunity and the see invisible intrinsic available from 
the Ancient Mummy Wrapping makes Li-Hon-Kay, a potential 20th Arena fight opponent, much 
easier to defeat.<p>
